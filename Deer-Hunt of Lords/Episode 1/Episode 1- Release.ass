Deer-Hunt of Lords
Episode 1
Oath of the Peach Garden
As ancient adage dictates: \N"The world under heaven,
Long divided, must unite.\NLong united, must divide."
Note: 771–476 BCE
In the times of Spring and Autumn,\Nfive hegemons strove for supremacy.
Note: 475–221 BCE
In the times of Warring States,\Nseven kingdoms clashed.
After five centuries of strife, they were quelled and united under Qín.
After the Qín fell,\Ntwo rival nations arose: Chǔ and Hàn.
Thus all were once again\Nunited under the Hàn.
In the 2nd year of Zhānghe\Nof the Eastern Hàn dynasty,
Note: 88 CE
the ten-year-old Emperor Hé of Hàn\Nascended the throne.
With the help of eunuchs, he was able\Nto depose Empress Dowager Dòu
along with her elder brother,\NGeneralissimo Dòu Xiàn.
Eunuchs became a part of government function,
thus their domination marked the\Nbeginning of the end for the Hàn.
Long live!
Long live!
Long live His Majesty!
Emperor Hé of Hàn
Long live!
Long live!
Long live His Majesty!
Over the next few decades,
contentions rose as the eunuchs amassed more power.
Emperor Shāng of Hàn
Emperor Ān
Emperor Shùn
Emperor Chōng
Emperor Zhì
Emperor Huán
Emperor Shāng of Hàn,
Emperor Ān,
Emperor Shùn,
Emperor Chōng,
Emperor Zhì,
Emperor Huán and Emperor Líng.
Emperors' deposition became constant \Nand the court's power withered away.
With this, local gentry became despots, extorting the people
and annexing land as natural\Ndisasters ravaged the country.
The common people were on a knife's edge, \Nliving in torment by desolation and starvation.
Zhāng Jiǎo
The Old Heaven is dead!
The Yellow Heaven shall rise!
On the year of Jiǎzǐ,
All shall prosper!
The Yellow Turban Rebellion
Driven to the brink, the people could only rebel.
Countless starving people rose high their flags, for one last, desperate push against fate.
Finally in the first month of\Nthe seventh year of Guānghé,
Note: January 184 CE
the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out.
They burned local government buildings,
murdered officials, and occupied cities.
War quickly broke out throughout the empire.
Within ten days,\Nnews of the rebellion had spread.
The empire was hurled into chaos.
Hé Jìn\NStyled: Suìgāo
Your Majesty, the Yellow Turbans are powerful and the Imperial Army is weak.
Permit the provinces to raise their own troops for defense.
Emperor Líng
I-I'll leave it to you,\NGeneralissimo!
Appoint generals to levy troops\Nto suppress the rebels.
Make it so.
Thank you, Your Majesty!
Administrator Liú Yān of Yōu Province\Nhereby announces to the public:
"The Yellow Turbans have rebelled against His Majesty."
"They are now invading\Nthe lands of Yōu Province,"
"causing harm and\Ncorrupting the common people."
"Local guardsmen are ill-prepared and inadequate to defend the province."
"With Heavens' mandate, His Majesty hath decreed:"
"Recruit strong and loyal\Nmen from all four corners"
"to reinforce the army\Nand protect the people."

You are a man, aren't you?\N The nation is in turmoil and all you do is sigh!
The market is open!
Butcher Zhāng?
Butcher Zhāng!
Hey, coming, coming.
Sir, I'm sorry. I'm afraid you\Nwon't be able to eat meat today.
You’re here, aren’t you?\NCut me some meat.
How can I sell the meat\Nif my boss isn't here?
I don't care. \NYou sell meat, I'll buy the meat.
I have the money, just give it!\NGo find Butcher Zhāng!
I dare not disturb him,\N you go find him yourself.
What's so difficult about slaughtering a pig?
Get your boss!
Brother, this is your business.
Why be afraid?\NJust sell the meat.
Well, you sell it then.\NI can't do it.
You see.
The meat is in the well,\Nbut I can't get it out.
I can't get it out.
Why not just move the millstone aside?
Move it?
Go ahead, move the millstone then.
I'll let you know my boss\Npromised earlier that
whoever can move this millstone, can keep the meat inside.
Go on!
Go on!
Move it and the meat is yours!
Isn't your boss going to lose his money?
Well, if you can't move the millstone, then quit running your mouth!
It's the boss' business if there's money made or lost.
Step back!
Yeah! Good work, my friend! Move it!
Where do you want it?
Uh, put it back in place!
Hold up!
Sir... powerful sir,\Nwhat will you do?
Cut the meat into small pieces.\NDistribute it to everyone.
Distribute?
The meat belongs to me now.\NJust do it.
Sure! I'll get right on it!
Come one, everyone, get you some meat.
Everyone, this meat is on me. Take a piece, please.
Go, go. Get me a piece, take it.
You were here to buy meat\Nso you must pay.
If others can take\N some, why can't I?
I-I can't take it anymore!\NPass me money, pass me money!
I'll pay! Sir, here's your payment!
Where is he? Where?
Over here, right here.
That's him.
He's there, good!
Fresh green beans, \Nwant to buy some?
What green beans?\NThis is clearly flour!
I sell fine products at a fair price.
It's nothing but flour!\NIt's nothing but flour!
Are you buying or milling?\NIf you're not buying, stop messing with them.
You get mad over a couple of beans!
Didn't you give away all my pork?
So you've come for a fight?
You're the one I want to hit!
If I want to make a name for myself,\Nwouldn't these two men be good companions?
He's really extraordinary.
This guy’s also a real man.
You two heroes have excellent martial arts.
It's admirable, really admirable!
That's too much.
Hey, I heard you lifted the millstone,
so I came here to see you myself,\Nthat's what I was about.[PLACEHOLDER]
Oh? I thought you came\Ndemanding money for the pork.
That little piece of pork?\NNot worth mentioning.
Come on!
Why don’t you two come to my place for a drink?
It's about to rain.\NLet's take shelter at your place.
Please!
Please!
Please!
I'm Zhāng Fēi styled Yìdé!
Note: Style names are given upon reaching adulthood. They're used as a form of respect between\Npeople of the same generation.
I love making friends with heroes from all over.
Today, I'm lucky to meet two new heroes!
It really puts me in a good mood.
After you?
Come, come! After you!
Come on, bring wine!
I'm Guān Yǔ, styled Yúnchǎng,\Nfrom Jiěliáng of Hédōng,
I'm Liú Bèi, styled Xuándé.
You first.
We three met by chance but feel familiar straight away.
After you!
After you.
Sit. Sit. Have a seat.
I've noticed that you two are no ordinary men.
Currently the Yellow Turbans are running rampant.\NThe realm is in chaos.
It's the time for heroes to rise. \NI wonder if you two heroes have a plan?
One day, back in Jiěliáng,
I couldn't tolerate a local despot oppressing the locals,
so in a fit of anger, I killed him.
I was forced to roam the jiānghú. It's been five or six years since the killing.
Note: The martial arts sub-culture that exist\Non the fringes of society.
I have many skills.\NI want to put them to use,
but in all my travels, I've found no opportunity to serve the country.
What's wrong with killing?
I hate that I haven't killed\Nall the villains in the world!
I saw the recruitment notice\Nat the city gate today.
I intend to enlist in the army, to test my sword and meet destiny on the battlefield.
Even if I die on the battlefield,\NI will die as a true and valiant man.
Yeah!
That's what a man ought to do.
I'll enlist with you.
What do you say?\NWill you enlist with us?
What’s with the long sigh?
Are you implying that men\Nshouldn't help their country?
Right now, it is a time of chaos,
heroes emerge in troubled times.
For heroes such as you two, \Nit is the time to show your valor.
But why must you subject\Nyourselves to serve others?
Don't you see?
These times will create heroes,\Nand those heroes will influence the times.
Now the Yellow Turbans are in rebellion\Nand the world has responded.
The court has ordered provinces to raise troops
because they are weak,\N with leaderless, feeble troops.
Also, the eunuchs continue to interfere.
Because of these things,
there is bound to be\Nanother rebellion against tyranny.
When the Yellow Turban Rebellion is crushed,
the heroes of the times\Nwill surely rise up as well.
Which hero will be the one\Nto hold power under heaven then?
No one knows for sure!
Hearing your speech is worth more\Nthan ten years of books!
It's admirable, really admirable!
I’m just a pig butcher.
I don't know what's\Nhappening in the world.
You just tell me what I should do.
Why are you so hesitant?
There is a man who was\Noriginally a scion of the Hàn dynasty.
His ancestor, Prince Jìng of Zhōngshān, was the 7th son of Emperor Xiàojǐng.
When his ancestor,\Nthe Marquis of Zhuōlù,
failed to pay his annual\Ntribute to his ancestors,
he was stripped of his rank.
A branch of his family\Nheaded out to the countryside
and settled down in Lóusāng Village.
Lóusāng Village? I know of it!
There's a thousand-year-old\Nmulberry tree there!
The tree is tall and crowned.\NHence the name, Lóusāng Village.
Note: Lóusāng literally means "giant mulberry"
I also heard people saying\Nthe mulberry tree shelters a nobleman!
Yes, I'm familiar with this saying.
However, for the last eighteen generations\N the descendants of this family
have been impoverished.\NThere's nothing but bare walls.
As an imperial scion,
why doesn't he restore\Nhis family's honor and rank?
He began wandering at age 15, seeking teachers and making friends.
He often thought of serving the state\Nand championing the people,
but now he's 28 and has achieved nothing.
In the end, all his\Naspirations will be spent in vain,
a heart full of tears.
Who are you talking about?
To tell you the truth...
It's the man before you.
Why didn't you say it earlier?
That nobleman is right before me?
Brother Liú you say it,\Nand old Zhāng will do it!
Say it!
I want to recruit local champions\Nand punish villains,
only I don't have the resources.
What's the problem?
I have the money.
I'm willing to do something for the people.
Are you serious?
I always speak the truth!
Alright!
Please!
A single thread cannot make a rope.
A single tree doesn't make a forest.
I'm weak and can't do it alone.
If you don't give up,\NI would gladly follow you!
You two are like charcoal during a snowstorm!
It's too generous of you two.
Liú Bèi pays his respects.
What's that for?
Brother Liú,\Nyou don't have to do that!
Wanting to achieve great deeds,
I've wandered about half my life
searching for like-minded\Npeople, until today.
After washing away the sand,\NI've finally discovered gold!
Destiny has brought us together.
I'm prepared to swear an oath of brotherhood\Nwith you two, sharing life and death.
How do you two feel about that?
I've also thought of this!
So long as we three share heart \Nand mind, clay can be changed to gold.
Together, with you leading us,\Nwe'll accomplish great deeds.
Although I'm just a fighter,\NI understand honor and loyalty.
As the adage goes,\N"a good bird chooses a good tree to perch on,"
"and a good man chooses\Na worthy lord to serve."
My life's wish is fulfilled.
From now on, my life is tied to yours.
My flesh is your flesh.
I'm fully committed!
Same with me!
I swear to go through thick and thin with you!
I'll be your companion through life or death.
Same with me!
If my words are false,\Nmay heaven strike me down.
Same with me!

Where are you running, rebel!?
Thank you, heroes, for saving me!
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.
May I ask what positions\Nyou three currently hold?
We are commoners.
Commoners?
Elder brother, you can't just...?
So annoying!
Third Brother, don't bother Elder Brother.
You achieved so much,
yet were rewarded with a\Nlowly magistrate post in Ānxǐ county.
That Sūn Jiān just curried favor\Nwith the higher-ups and was made a major.
What for?
That stinking imperial court,\Nit deserves its rebellions!
Third Brother, watch your tongue.
He's a commander of \Nthe imperial court, don't be rash.
And what about that Dǒng Zhuó! He did nothing, yet received a good magistrate position!
By connecting with wealthy men
and bribing the Ten Attendants,
Note: The Ten Attendants are the faction of eunuchs that control the Imperial Court.
That day on the battlefield,
remember what he was like? \NTrying to flee like a coward!
If it wasn't for us...
If it was up to me,\NI'd kill him myself!
Elder Brother, say something!
The County Inspector
Are you the new magistrate of this county?
Yes.
What's your name?
Liú Bèi.
Ah, Liú Bèi?
What's your background?
I'm descended from Emperor Xiàojǐng\Nthrough Prince Jìng of Zhōngshān.
So you're a scion of the Hàn dynasty?
Yes.
Pardon me for lacking manners, my good sir.
That's not necessary.
Since you're an imperial clansman,\Nplease do sit down, good sir. Let's talk.
Thank you.
Liú Bèi,
since you're an imperial scion, may I ask
why are you holding such a\Nlowly post as a county magistrate?
Regardless of my post, \NI'll do my best to help the court.
Who recommended you to take this post, sir?
I started recruiting within Zhuō commandery to suppress the Yellow Turbans.
I have been in more than thirty battles.
For my humble merits,\NI was rewarded with this post.
You've got to find a big tree\Nto lean on in the court,
then you can lie low in the shade.
Then again, it's fairly easy being a lowly official.
It's harder for those higher on the ladder.
Whenever you want to do\N something, you need to pay up.
I'm an honest official, I've never committed any offense against the people.
Not the slightest offense?
Really?
I dare not deceive you.
Since you're so confident\N Magistrate Liú, I'd still like to check into it.
Elder Brother, how was it?
Did the Inspector trouble you, Elder Brother?
It's alright.
That's good.
He didn't ask for a bribe?
Not outright, but he was hinting at it.
But I turned a deaf ear to him.
I could never exploit or mistreat the people. How could I afford to bribe him?
Even if you had money, don't give it to him!\NWe'll see what he'll do next.
Magistrate Liú,
you're wanted by the Inspector.
What? The Inspector again?
Damned bureaucrat, merely a bully\Nleaning on the powerful. Don't go!
The Inspector must be plotting something.
Best be careful.
You're right, the Inspector\Nmust be harboring evil intentions.
I'll go anyway.
Yúnchǎng, Third Brother,\Nyou two wait for me at home.
After you.
After you.
What's your name?
Liú Bèi.
What's your background?
I'm descended from Emperor Xiàojǐng through Prince Jìng of Zhōngshān.
Outrageous!\NYou dare pretend to be an imperial scion?
I wouldn't dare pretend!
You dare answer back?
How did you get this post,\Nhow much did you pay in bribes?
Hurry up! Tell the truth!
I started recruiting in Zhuō county to suppress the Yellow Turbans.
I've been in more than thirty battles. For my humble merits, I was rewarded with this post.
How dare you lie about your feats!
I lied about nothing!
It's my duty to clean up\Ncorrupt officials like you!
Then do investigate!
Leave now. If I find any wrongdoing, you'll be sorry!
I take my leave!
This Liú Bèi is so stubborn.
Inspector, as the saying goes,\N"a thief bites down to the bone."
Note: This saying means that bad or wronged people will be vindictive.
The Inspector announces\Na hearing in three days.
During these three days, anyone\Nwho is dissatisfied with the magistrate, [PLACEHOLDER]
has experienced injustice, corruption, or has any evidence of crimes done against the people
will be the first to be heard.
The Inspector will protect you.\NYou don't have to be afraid.
Hey, do you hear me?
Take revenge for the injustices done to you.
Good sir,
since Magistrate Liú took office,\Nhe's committed no misdeeds.
He loves the common people.
He has done no misdeeds.
Yeah, he's done nothing wrong.
Did he privately threaten you?
Nothing like that, absolutely not.
Ignorant peasants!
Elder Brother, the Inspector is\Ndeliberately trying to frame you.
Let me go beat him and run him\Nout of Ānxǐ county. It'll be easy.
Third brother, don't be so reckless.
Damn!
Can't beat him, can't even curse him!
I can't stand it!
Third Brother!
Where are you going?
I can't stand it here!
I'm going for a walk.
Third Brother,
don't be reckless.
Damn!
Elder Brother,
I'm going outside the city to ride my horse.
Alright,
but only outside the city.
Understood.
Magistrate Liú, please.
Master Zhāng, the Inspector has been\Nintimidating us to turn against Lord Liú.
Master Zhāng, we went to petition on behalf of Lord Liú,
but the Inspector wouldn't let us in\Nand he even beat us.
Elder Brother!
Elder Brother!
You bureaucrat cur, where's my Elder Brother!?
You bureaucrat cur!
Go!
Save me! Save me!
You cur! I should beat you to death!
Third Brother, stop!
Lord Xuándé, save me!
Killing this scumbag would be a good deed!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
Inspector, my Elder Brother\Nhas been nothing but dutiful!
He's honest and cares for\Nthe people like his own children!
Why do you try to harm him?
You only know how to steal money and ask for bribes!
Clearly it's you who's the corrupt one!
My Elder Brother is innocent.\NWhere would he have the money for bribes?
You sell positions and\Nconfiscate property on false charges.
You deserve this punishment!
Lord Xuándé, sirs, sirs,\Nspare my life! Spare me!
Elder Brother, you've achieved so much on the battlefield,
yet only got to be a county magistrate.
And now, you get slandered by this Inspector.
This place is a thorn bush,\Nnot fit for a phoenix to perch on.
Better to kill him, resign this post,\Nthen head out for a new opportunity!
Forgive me! I'll never do it again!\NThose above forced me into it!
Subordinates follow their superiors!
Inspector! You tried to frame the honest\Nand you tried to harm the people.
You deserve to be put down like a dog,\N but I will spare you this once.
Thank you for your favor, Lord Xuándé!
My post...
Note: Stamp seals represent government positions, and were required for decisions to be legal.
you may keep it.
Lord Liú, please don't go!
Lord Liú, please don't go!
To avoid prosecution,\NLiú Bèi and his two brothers
became captains under Liú Yu.
After Gōngsūn Zàn mentioned Liú's previous achievements,
he was promoted to major for the Píngyuán county magistrate.
There he gradually regrouped his old forces.
