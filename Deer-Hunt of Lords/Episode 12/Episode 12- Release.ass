Very ambiguous here about the city. Is it Chen Gui's, or is it Xu-Province?
This is a Gentlemen of the Hàn free fansub.
Episode 12
White Gate Tower (Part 1)
Cáo Cāo's large army experienced\Nmore than one month of tedious battles.
They eventually conquered\NShòuchūn and routed Yuán Shù.
At this time, Zhāng Xiù and Liú Biǎo
took advantage of Cáo Cāo's absence\Nfrom Xǔdū (Xǔchāng) to attack the Central Plains.
Cáo Cāo was forced to lead\Nhis army to defend Xǔdū.
On the 3rd year of the Jiàn'ān era, three more\Ninvasions against Zhāng Xi commenced.
Note: 198-199 CE
Cáo Cāo's army is here!
Run away! Run away!
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
Send someone, to inform\Nall the villagers, far or near,
that I was ordered by the Emperor\Nto send an army against a rebellion!
However, it coincides with the\Nharvest season, Lieutenant.
We have to go through the wheat,\Nbut whoever tramples them...
must be beheaded.
Yes!
With strict orders, the people can safely\Nharvest wheat; no need to be anxious.
Yes!
Halt!
My orders are utmostly important,\Nso you ought to be careful and obey it as well.
Yes!
Where is the Provost Marshal?
The\NProvost Marshal
Here.
My horse trampled the wheat;\Nhow shall I be punished?
Chancellor, how can I punish you?
If I broke the law knowingly, but was absolved,\Nhow could the masses trust us?
Guō Jiā\NStyled: Fèngxiào
Chancellor! Chancellor!
Everyone stop!
Do not oppose my orders.
Sir, during the Spring and Autumn period, \Nthose laws were not applied to the venerated.
Sir, you lead a grand army.\NHow could you harm yourself?
Chancellor! Chancellor!
Since the Spring and Autumn's laws\Ndoes not apply to those of esteem,
I will not execute myself for now.
Chancellor!
However, military orders are like mountains,\Nso although I shall be spared,
Note: This idiom means that military orders cannot be violated, just like how mountains cannot be moved.
I shall substitute my head with my hair.
Chancellor.
Where are we?
20 lǐ ahead is Wǎnchéng.
Where is Yùshuǐ-River?
When we reach the grand mound on the right.\NYùshuǐ-River is below it.
Like a solitary leaf in the wind, I wither.
Born under an unlucky star,\Nmy life has been bitter;
escaping from the chaos, I encountered you.
I am most grateful for\Nyour kindness when we met;
{\i1}your love brings but temporary happiness.
The beacon signals an auspicious occasion.
Dian Wei
With tears in my eyes for your life,
Cao Ang
Wáng Hòu
wine conceals the scars of warfare.{\i0}
Dim, so dim is the lamplight;{\i1}
deep, so deep is this tent.{\i1}
The soft pouring of wine;{\i1}
the soft words spoken.{\i1}
An instant of elation;{\i1}
an instant of comfort.{\i1}
Who will understand the meaning of my verse;{\i1}
who will empathize with the person in this song?{\i1}
General Dian Wei,\NI have come to attend your memorial!
I have lost my beloved\Nson and nephew...
but I do not mourn so heavily\Nfor them as for General Diǎn Wéi!
But until today,
I haven't even found my general's remains!
Chancellor.
Why not hold a memorial here now?
A memorial...
for the warriors who fell in battle at Shòuchūn.
A memorial for the supplies overseer, Wáng Hòu.
Correct... we should... we should...
but... but where is Wáng Hòu's head?
Chancellor!
Chancellor!
Cáo Cāo subdued Zhāng Xiù once again,
Although he triumphed, his heart\Nand emotions were but very heavy.
What shall his next step be?
Yuán Shào intended to exploit my invasion against Zhāng Xiù to scout and map Xǔdū (Xǔchāng).
Now he saw me return and used a\Ndeft excuse to conceal his intentions.
That man is indeed hateful.
Yuán Shào is too sordid,
he needs to be fought.
I only regret I am unable to do so.
Gentlemen, do you have any ideas? Do share.
Chancellor.
Fèngxiào, please tell.
As I see it,
(Yuán) Shào has ten disadvantages;\Nyou have ten advantages.
Yuán Shào may have the larger army,\Nbut it is nothing to be fearful of.
I have ten advantages;\NShào has ten disadvantages?
Fèngxiào, elaborate.
Shào is liturgical and doctrinaire,\NYou are generous and grounded.
In conduct, you win.
Shào is obstinate,\NYou are flexible.
In popularity, you win.
Ever since the reigns of\NEmperors Huán and Líng passed,
the state is injudicious,\NShào even more so.
You strive for efficiency.\NIn politics, you win.
Shào seems populist but is envious inside.\NHe gives into nepotism.
You seem critical but are clear-cut inside.\N You appoint those of merit.
In magnanimity, you win.
Shào makes plans but can't commit,\Nyou are cunning and decisive.
In strategy, you win.
Shào collects those for fame,\Nyou treat people as they are.
In virtue, you win.
Shào cares for the close but ignores the far.\NYou worry for all despite distance.
In benevolence, you win.
Shào is flustered by deception\Nyou may be misled but maintain your quo.
In perception, you win.
Shào's sense of right is muddled,\Nyour standards upstanding.
In competency, you win.
Shào loves to make empty threats but lacks tactical ability.
Your armies are less, but can defeat the many
In warfare, you win.
With these ten advantages,
how hard would it be to defeat Yuǎn Shào?
If that is the case,
I shall send an army to attack Yuán Shào.
Having said that,
Chancellor, before you attack Yuán Shào,
we need to settle a major threat\Nwithin your heart first.
Major threat?
What major threat in my heart?
Lǚ Bù of Xú-Province. \NHe is the major threat within your heart.
Chancellor, you can first take on him,\N wiping the threats in the southeast,
then plan against Yuán Shào.
If Lǚ Bù, three times a wanton traitor, is left alive, he will become a hazard.
Conquer Lǚ Bù, wipe out this major threat!
Lǚ Bù told me to detain Hán Yìn
and send him to Xǔdū for you to deal with.
Chén Dēng\NStyled: Yuánlóng
Lǚ Bù is brave and candid,\Nbut he also acts like a rabid wolf.
He only sees in the short-term, acting with reckless abandon.
My lord, you should plan against him first.
Chén Dēng,
you are the envoy for Lǚ Bù.
Why would you, in front of me, slander your lord?
Eh... my lord.
My ancestral home was in Xú-Province.
I initially assisted Táo Qiān, then Liú Bèi.
But after a drunk Zhāng Fēi bungled matters
and beat up Lǚ Bù's father-in-law,
Lǚ Bù retaliated and seized Xú-Province.
Because my father was still in service to him,
I couldn't abandon him;
I had to bend myself to serve under him.
I had but no choice, that is all.
Forgive me for my inconsiderate assumption.
I hope you will accept it.
I know Lǚ Bù has the wild ambitions of a rabid wolf.\NIt will be hard to feed him for long.
Sire, what plans do you suggest?
Chancellor, if you decide to act,\NI shall serve as your spy.
Good. I shall bestow you the title of\N Administrator of Guǎnglíng.
Thank you, Chancellor!
Wait.
I shall entrust the matters of Xú-Province to you.
Can you do it?
Chancellor, rest assured.
General.
Ah, you returned.
Yes.
How is Xǔdū faring?
Lord Cáo presented me 2,000 shí for my father
and appointed me as the\N Administrator of Guǎnglíng.
You didn't vouch for me to be\N{\i1}the Potentate {\i0}of Xú-Province,
but got yourself all the benefits?
Your father advised me to ally with Cáo Cāo,
call off the marriage between Yuán Shù,\Nand send Hán Yìn for execution.
I expected to be promoted\Nby now but I got nothing!
Yet you and your father both got noble titles!
You two have betrayed me!
Why are you laughing?
Because of your ignorance to the real meaning!
After I met Lord Cáo, I petitioned for you\Nto be the Potentate of Xú-Province.
I said, "Supporting Lǚ Bù\Nwould be like raising a tiger."
"You ought to fully feed him\Nwith meat, lest he starts eating men."
Lord Cáo said, "No. I must raise him,"
"not as a tiger, but rather a hawk."
"If the foxes and rabbits aren't rested,"
"you mustn't fully feed the eagle then."
If the eagle is famished, then he is of my use.
"If full, he will surely then fly away."
I then asked Lord Cáo,
"Then who are the foxes and rabbits?"
The reply was,
"Yuán Shù of Huáinán, Sūn Cè of Jiāngdōng,"
"Yuán Shào of Jìzhōu, Liú Biǎo of Jīngxiāng,"
"Liú Zhāng of Yìzhōu, and Zhāng Lǔ of Hànzhōng."
"They are the foxes and rabbits."
Chén Gōng\NStyled: Gōngtái
General, no need to be humble!
You've done many great deeds for the empire.
You ought to be ranked among\Nthe Three Excellencies!
Note: The Excellencies are the highest \Nofficials in the Imperial Court
Yuánlóng, you're flattering me.
Gōngtái?
What are you here for?
General, if he has something to say,\Nlet us excuse ourselves.
General, let us take our leave now. Farewell.
Farewell!
Gōngtái, what exactly is wrong?
The father-son duo often flatter\Nand sweet-talk you, General.
I fear unspeakable motives in their heart.
General, you ought to be on guard.
Or is it that you are slandering\Ngood men for no reason?
Isn't that why you waited?
If you ignore my loyal words,\Nwe will will suffer disaster!
Spare me!
Behead him!
Sire, spare me, please!
Spare me!
Who is this?
Exalted sire, Chancellor Cáo sent me\Nto deliver Liú of Yù-Province a message!
Liú Bèi replied and sent me back! I just want to go back!
I really don't know what the contents are!
Exalted sires, spare me!
I'm begging you, spare me!
Sires, spare me!
Sires...
Sires, spare me!
Spare me, please!
As my lord has instructed,
The plan against Lǚ Bù continues without hesitation,
but with so few soldiers,\NI wouldn't dare take him lightly.
But if Chancellor were to strike,\NI could lead the vanguard.
My armies prepared.\NI await further orders, sire.
That bastard has the nerve to...!?
Gōngtái, get me-!
Exalted sire, spare me!
Exalted sire, mercy!
Mercy, please!
Xiǎopèi
Liú Bèi! You joined forces with\NCáo Cāo to harm my master!
You better come out and surrender!
Liú Bèi\NStyled: Xuándé
Our city is too small. How can we guard it?
We must think of a plan.
Sūn Qián,\NStyled: Gōngyòu
We could ally with Cáo Cāo.
I'll send a message right now.
Good.
Report! Lǚ Bù's general, Zhāng Liáo,\Nis attacking the Western gate!
Fire!
Halt.
Zhāng Liáo\NStyled: Wényuǎn
General Zhāng!
General Guān!
Xiǎopèi's\NWestern Gate
General Zhāng, we have met each other many a time.
I've long known of your exemplary character!
Guān Yǔ\NStyled: Yúncháng
But what is Lǚ Bù?
Sir, you should know best!
General, you are man among men. Why debase yourself to serving a bastard of three surnames?
Hold the city. Don't meet them outside!
Yes, sir!
To the Eastern gate!
Open the Eastern gate!
Xiǎopèi's\NEastern Gate
Third Brother!
Zhāng Fēi\NStyled: Yìdé
Third Brother!
We mustn't underestimate Zhāng Liáo's power.\NFurthermore, he is an honorable man.
Having thus spoken, my words will surely\Ninfluence him to have regrets at heart;
It is evident he does not want to fight us.
Xǔdū (Xǔchāng)
Lǚ Bù indeed attacked Xiǎopèi.
Lǚ Bù is that brave...
If he allies with Yuán Shù once again,
it would be hard to plan against them.
We can exploit his "rebellion"\Nto disrupt the hearts of his people.\N
Good!
An army to Xú-Province!
Xiàhóu Dūn\NStyled: Yuánràng
Report!
Report! Ahead is Lǚ Bù's subordinate\NGāo Shùn! He's blocking the way!
Destroy them!
Charge!
Gāo Shùn
Charge!
Cáo Xìng
Essence of my father and blood of my mother!\NHow could I waste it?
Father.
Chén Guī
Father, Lord Cáo has joined forces with\NLiú Bèi and have marched here.
I want help them in a major way.
Father, do you have any instructions?
Lord Cáo once said,
"Everything in Xú-Province will be in your hands."
Soon, Lǚ Bù will be defeated.
My son, you ought to exploit the absence of Lǚ Bù
to help Cáo from the inside!
Regarding outside matters,\NI will take care of them.
Father, you should ask Lǚ Bù to guard Xú-Province with Mí Zhú.
If Lǚ Bù is routed, he shall not be allowed to enter the city.
The plan is not bad.
However, you will be with Lǚ Bù outside as well.
Your son will find a means of escape.
It is easy to prevent Lǚ Bù from entering the city,
however, his family resides in Xú-Province.
In addition, within the city are many loyalists.
What to do about them?
Of his loyalists and family,
your son has a plan to deal with them.
Father, you may rest assured.
Good. But due to Lǚ Bù's unfaithful and erratic behavior,
my son, you must proceed with caution.
You mustn't be too cocky.
Yes, father.
General!
Yuánlóng.
Here.
Chén Gōng persuaded me to guard Xiāo-Pass.
How to make the Cáo army retreat?
Yuánlóng, explain in detail.
Yes.
General, Cáo Cāo intends to seize Xú-Province this time.
Now Xú-Province is surrounded on all sides, a dangerous position.
General, you should first think of a way to fallback.
General, better to move your provisions and economy to Xiàpī.
That way, if Xú-Province happens to fall,\NXiàpī will be able to supply you.
General, act on this plan as soon as you can.
Yuánlóng, your words are utmostly correct.
Sòng Xiàn and Wèi Xù!
Here!
I want you two to move the provisions and\Ntransfer them to Xiàpī as soon as you can.
And bring my family as well!
Yes, sir!
Yuánlóng!
Here.
Follow me to reinforce Xiāo-Pass.
Heed my orders!
General!
Let me go to Xiāo-Pass first and investigate this Cáo army.
Then you may advance, General.
So this is even better!
General, I will depart now.
Xiāo Pass
Our lord resents you for not advancing.\NHe will come here to admonish you.
Their army is mighty and\Nwe cannot underestimate them.
My army is here to guard the pass.\NI would rather die than lose it!
You may return and inform our lord to\Nguard Xiǎopèi himself. That is the best plan.
Yes.
Wait.
You mustn't persuade our lord\Nwith a go along with plan to abandon the city.
Yes.
Someone's firing arrows from the wall!
My lord?
Chén Dēng pays his deepest respects to Lord Cáo.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xiāo-Pass.
Tomorrow night, a fire will start on the city walls,
I will lay a trap that will cause Lǚ Bù and Chén Gōng to fight each other.
Sire, you can then take the pass and reach Xú-Province.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xú-Province.
When Lǚ Bù retreats to Xú-Province,
my father and Mí Zhú would have already seized control.
Sire must send an army to receive them.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xiǎopèi.
I will first lure Gāo Shùn and\NZhāng Liáo out of Xiǎopèi,
Sire, can exploit this opportunity,
then Xiǎopèi will belong to you, sire!
Good!
Good!
Chén Yuánlóng stands within fierce and bellowing waves,
but toyed with it all!
Good!
General-
Of Xiāo-Pass?
Had I not went there,\Nit would've been in danger.
Sūn Guān and company dreaded the ferocity of\NCáo's army and wished to surrender the pass.
I have left Chén Gōng to guard it.
General, at night, you ought to reinforce them.
Return to Xiāo-Pass first and inform\NChén Gōng to prevent sedition.
At evening, I shall aid him.
Signal us using a torch and have\NChén Gōng kill the rebels from within.
Yes.
Cáo's army took a small road\Nand is outside the pass.
I fear that Xú-Province will fall. I hope you, Gōngtái,\Nwill lead an army to save it.
Charge!
Xiāo Pass
Kill!
Charge!
How can it be you...?!
We've been deceived! We need to save Xú-Province!
Go!
Xú-Province
Open the gates!
I am Lǚ Bù!
Lǚ Bù! You stole my lord's city!\NNow you ought to return it to him!
Where is Chén Dēng's father?!
Him? We already killed him!
Mí Zhú\NStyled: Zǐzhòng
Where is Chén Dēng?!
Chén Dēng!
Chén Dēng!
My lord! We already fell for Chén Dēng's dirty trick!
Chén Dēng! Chén Dēng-
My lord! We have to go and save Xiǎopèi now!
Chén Dēng!
Why aren't you guarding Xiǎopèi? Why come here?
Chén Dēng reported that you were surrounded,\Nso we came to save you!
Chén Dēng! I swear I will kill you!
Go!
Xiǎopèi
Chén Dēng!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
My lord! Retreat now to Xiàpī!
Fine... go!
Charge!
Xiàpī
Lady Yán
My lady, cheers.
General, you mustn't be too angry.
Chén Dēng betrayed you by relinquishing the city. That is detestable.
But think about it,
if it weren't for Yuánlóng urging you to move to Xiàpī,
Today... this wine would-
A woman's opinion!
If it weren't for Chén Dēng's plan,
then how could I lose Xiāo Pass and Xiǎopèi?
And how then could Xú-Province\Nfall into the hands of others so easily?
Perhaps to use another ploy?
Before then, you've blamed Chén Gōng.\NNow, you blame Chén Dēng.
General, whom are you angry with?
I am just a woman. How could I know?
You have no place for these matters!
Prepare more wine and food.
I will meet Chén Gōng personally. \NTogether, we can remove all our worries.
