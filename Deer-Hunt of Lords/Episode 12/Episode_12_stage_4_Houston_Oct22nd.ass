Episode 12
White Gate Tower (Part 1)
Cáo Cāo's large army experienced\Nmore than one month of tedious battles.
They eventually conquered\NShòuchūn and routed Yuán Shù.
At this time, Zhāng Xiù and Liú Biǎo
took advantage of Cáo Cāo's absence\Nfrom Xǔdū to attack the Central Plains.
Cáo Cāo was forced to lead\Nhis army to defend Xǔdū.
On the 3rd year of the Jiàn'ān era, three more\Ninvasions against Zhāng Xi commenced.
Note: 198-199 AD
Cáo Cāo's army is here!
Run away! Run away!
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
Send someone, to inform\Nall the villagers, far or near,
that I was ordered by the Emperor\Nto send an army against a rebellion!
However, it coincides with the\Nharvest season, Lieutenant.
We have to go through the wheat,\Nbut whoever tramples them...
must be beheaded.
Yes!
With strict orders, the people can safely\Nharvest wheat; no need to be anxious.
Yes!
Halt!
My orders are utmostly important,\Nso you ought to be careful and obey it as well.
Yes!
Where is the Provost Marshal?
The\NProvost Marshal
Here.
My horse trampled the wheat;\Nhow shall I be punished?
Prime Minister, how can I punish you?
If I knew the law and broke it, but was absolved,\Nhow could the masses trust us?
Guō Jiā\NStyled: Fèngxiào
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!
Everyone stop!
Do not oppose my orders.
Sir, during the Autumn and Spring period, \Nthose laws were not applied to the venerated.
Sir, you lead a grand army.\NHow could you harm yourself?
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!
Since the Spring and Autumn laws\Ndo not apply to those of esteem,
I will not execute myself for now.
Prime Minister!
However, military orders are like mountains,\Nso although I shall be spared,
This idiom means that military orders cannot be violated, just like how mountains cannot be moved.
I shall substitute my head with my hair.
Prime Minister.
Where are we?
20 lǐ ahead is Wǎnchéng.
Where is Yùshuǐ-river?
We are on the right side of a grand mound.\NYùshuǐ River is below it.

General Dian Wei,\NI have come to attend your memorial!
I have lost my beloved\Nson and nephew...
but I do not mourn so heavily\Nfor them as for General Diǎn Wéi!
But until today,
I haven't even found my general's remains!
Prime Minister.
Why not hold a memorial herenow?
A memorial...
for the warriors who fell in battle at Shòuchūn.
A memorial for the supplies overseer, Wáng Hòu.
Correct... we should... we should...
but... but where is Wáng Hòu's head?
Prime Minister!
Prime Minister!
Cáo Cāo subdued Zhāng Xiù once again,
Although he triumphed, his heart\Nand emotions were still very heavy.
What shall his next step be?
Yuán Shào intended to exploit my invasion\Nagainst Zhāng Xiù to scout and map Xǔdū.
Now he saw me return and used a\Ndeft excuse to conceal his intentions.
That man is indeed hateful.
Yuán Shào is too sordid,
I want to attack him;
I only regret I am unable to do so.
Gentlemen, do you have any ideas? Do share.
Prime Minister.
Fèngxiào, please tell.
As your humble servant sees it,
Shào has ten disadvantages;\Nyou have ten advantages.
Yuán Shào may have the larger army,\Nbut it is nothing to be fearful of.
I have ten advantages;\NShào has ten disadvantages?
Fèngxiào, elaborate.
Shào elaborates himself in ceremony and formality;\NYou are generous and natural.
In conduct, you win.
Shào is intransigent;\NYou are compromising.
In popularity, you win.
Ever since the reigns of\NEmperors Huán and Líng passed,
the state has been more negligent;\NShào even more so.
You strive for efficiency.\NIn politics, you win.
Shào seems populist but envious inside.\NHe gives into nepotism.
You seem exigent but concise inside.\N You appoint those of merit.
In magnanimity, you win.
Shào has more plans but is indecisive;\Nyou are cunning and prompt.
In strategy, you win.
Shào collects those of fame;\Nyou treat people as they are.
In virtue, you win.
Shào cares for the close but ignores the far.\NYou worry for all despite distance.
In benevolence, you win.
Shào listens to lies and is deceived;\Nyou may be misled but maintain your quo.
In perception, you win.
Shào's sense between right or wrong is tangled;\Nyour selection of moral people is accurate.
In competency, you win.
Shào loves to make empty threats\Nand is dim in military tactics;
You have the lesser army,\Nbut direct them as a god would.
In war, you win.
With these ten advantages,
how hard would it be to defeat Yuǎn Shào?
If that is the case,
I shall send an army to attack Yuán Shào.
Having said that,
Prime Minister, before you attack Yuán Shào,
we need to settle a major threat\Nwithin your heart first.
Major threat?
What major threat in my heart?
Lǚ Bù of Xúzhōu. He is actually the\Nmajor threat within your heart.
Prime Minister, you can first take on him,\N wiping the threats in the southeast,
then plan against Yuán Shào.
Lǚ Bù repeatedly revolted when subordinate.
呂布反复小人不除
Killing him would end a major threat!
I shall act against Lǚ Bù and end a major threat.
Lǚ Bù told me to detain Hán Yìn
and send him to Xǔdū for you to deal with.
Chén Dēng\NStyled: Yuánlóng
Lǚ Bù is brave and candid,\Nbut he also acts like a rabid wolf.
He only sees profit and forgets justice.\NHe acts so recklessly.
My lord, you should plan against him first.
Chén Dēng,
you are the envoy for Lǚ Bù.
Why would you, in front of me, slander your lord?
Eh... my lord.
My ancestral home was in Xúzhōu.
I initially assisted Táo Qiān, then Liú Bèi.
But after a drunk Zhāng Fēi bungled matters
and beat up Lǚ Bù's father-in-law,
Lǚ Bù retaliated and seized Xúzhōu.
Because my father was still in service to him,
I couldn't abandon him;
I had to bend myself to serve under him.
I had but no choice, that is all.
Forgive me for my inconsiderate assumption.
I hope you will accept it.
I know Lǚ Bù has the wild ambitions of a rabid wolf.\NIt will be hard to feed him for long.
Sire, what plans do you suggest?
Prime Minister, if you decide to act,\NI shall serve as your spy.
Good. I shall bestow you the title of\N Administrator of Guǎnglíng.
Thank you, Prime Minister!
Wait.
I shall entrust the matters of Xúzhōu to you.
Can you do it?
Prime Minister, rest assured.
General.
Ah, you returned.
Yes.
How is Xǔdū faring?
Lord Cáo presented me 2,000 {\i1}shí{\i0} for my father
and appointed me as the\N Administrator of Guǎnglíng.
You didn't petition for me to be\Nthe Governor of Xúzhōu,
but rather benefit yourself?
Your father advised me to ally with Cáo Cāo,
call off the marriage between Yuán Shù,\Nand send Hán Yìn for execution.
I expected to be promoted\Nby now but I got nothing!
You and your father both got nobler titles!
The two of you sold me out!
Why are you laughing?
Because of your ignorance to the real meaning!
After I met Lord Cáo, I petitioned for you\Nto be the Governor of Xúzhōu.
I said, "Supporting Lǚ Bù\Nwould be like raising a tiger."
"You ought to fully feed him\Nwith meat lest he eat humans."
Lord Cáo said, "No. I must raise him."
"And not like a tiger, but rather a hawk."
"If the foxes and rabbits aren't dead,"
"you mustn't fully feed the eagle then."
If the eagle is famished, then he is of my use.
"If full, he will surely then fly away."
I then asked Lord Cáo,
"Then who are the foxes and rabbits?"
The reply was,
"Yuán Shù of Huáinán, Sūn Cè of Jiāngdōng,"
"Yuán Shào of Jìzhōu, Liú Biǎo of Jīngxiāng,"
"Liú Zhāng of Yìzhōu, and Zhāng Lǔ of Hànzhōng."
"They are the foxes and rabbits."
Chén Gōng\NStyled: Gōngtái
General, no need to be humble!
You've done many great deeds for the empire.
You ought to be ranked among\Nthe Three Excellencies!
Yuánlóng, you're flattering me.
Gōngtái?
What are you here for?
General, if he has something to say,\Nlet us excuse ourselves.
General, let us take our leave now. Farewell.
Farewell!
Gōngtái, what exactly is wrong?
The father-son duo often flatter\Nand sweet-talk you, General.
I fear unspeakable motives in their heart.
General, you ought to be on guard.
Or is it that you are slandering\Ngood men for no reason?
Isn't that why you waited?
If you ignore my loyal words,\Nour generation will surely suffer disaster!
Spare me!
Behead him!
Sire, spare me, please!
Spare me!
Who is this?
Exalted sire, Chancellor Cáo sent me\Nto deliver Liú of Yùzhōu a message!
Liú Bèi replied and sent me back! I just want to go back!
I really don't know what the contents are!
Exalted sires, spare me!
I'm begging you, spare me!
Sires, spare me!
Sires...
Sires, spare me!
Spare me, please!
Receiving your orders,
I have plotted against Lǚ Bù and\Nwouldn't dare slack off day or night,
but with few active soldiers,\NI wouldn't dare take him lightly.
Prime Minister, if you would attack him,\NI would lead the vanguard
with a disciplined and sturdy army.\NI await further orders, sire.
严兵整甲
How dare that villain plot in this way!
Gōngtái, get me-
Exalted sire, spare me!
Exalted sire, mercy!
Mercy, please!
Xiǎopèi
Liú Bèi! You joined forces with\NCáo Cāo to harm my master!
You better come out and surrender!
Liú Bèi\NStyled: Xuándé
Our walls are too small. How can we guard it?
We must think of a plan.
Sūn Qián,\NStyled: Gōngyòu
We could join up with Cáo Cāo.
I'll send a message right now.
Good.
Report! Lǚ Bù's general, Zhāng Liáo,\Nis attacking the Western gate!
Fire!
Halt.
Zhāng Liáo\NStyled: Wényuǎn
General Zhāng!
General Guān!
Xiǎopèi's\NWestern Gate
General Zhāng, we are already\Nfamiliar with each other!
I've long known of your staunch loyalty, General!
Guān Yǔ\NStyled: Yúncháng
Who is Lǚ Bù really? 
Sir, you know who he is!
General, you are majestic, so why cast yourself\Nto serving a slave of three surnames?
Hold the city. Don't meet them outside!
Yes!
To the Eastern gate!
Open the Eastern gate!
Xiǎopèi's\NEastern Gate
Third Brother!
Zhāng Fēi\NStyled: Yìdé
Third Brother!
We mustn't underestimate Zhāng Liáo's power.\NFurthermore, he has an aura of loyalty.
Having thus spoken, my words will surely\Ninfluence him to have regrets at heart.
It is evident he does not want to fight us.
Xǔdū
Lǚ Bù indeed attacked Xiǎopèi.
Lǚ Bù is that brave...
If he allies with Yuán Shù once again,
it would be hard to plan against them.
We can exploit his 'rebellion'\Nto disrupt the hearts of his people.\N
可乘其初叛 人心不定时
Good!
An army to Xúzhōu!
Xiàhóu Dūn\NStyled: Yuánràng
Report!
Report! Ahead is Lǚ Bù's subordinate\NGāo Shùn! He's blocking the way!
Destroy them!
Charge!
Gāo Shùn
Charge!
Cáo Xìng
Essence of my father and blood of my mother!\NHow could I waste it?
Father.
Chén Guī
Father, Lord Cáo has joined forces with\NLiú Bèi, and they have marched here.
I want to help them in a major way.
Father, do you have any instructions?
Lord Cáo once said,
"Everything in Xúzhōu will be in your hands."
Soon, Lǚ Bù will be defeated.
Pretty sure Chen Gui is not quoting Cao Cao so no quotes for the above line. [[NOTE: But he is. "Fuqing, any ideas?" // "Dang1chu1_Cao2gong1_?ceng?_yan2  (Originally_Lord Cao_??_speech]]
My son, you ought to exploit the absence of Lǚ Bù
to help Cáo from the inside!
Regarding outside matters,\NI will take care of them.
Father, you should ask Lǚ Bù to guard Xúzhōu with Mí Zhú.
If Lǚ Bù is routed, you must\Nnot let him enter the city.
Very ambiguous here about the city. Is it Chen Gui's, or is it Xuzhou?
Of this plan... it is not bad.
However, you will be with Lǚ Bù outside as well.
Your son will find a means of escape.
It is easy to prevent Lǚ Bù from entering the city.
However, his family resides in Xúzhōu.
In addition, within the city are many loyalists.
What to do about them?
Of his loyalists and family,
your son has a plan to deal with them.
Father, you may rest assured.
Good. But due to Lǚ Bù's unfaithful and erratic behavior,
my son, you must proceed with caution in your plan.
You mustn't be too cocky.
Yes, father.
General!
Yuánlóng.
Here.
Chén Gōng persuaded me to guard Xiāo pass.
How to make the Cáo army retreat?
Yuánlóng, please help me in all your heart.
Yes.
General, Cáo Cāo intends to seize Xúzhōu this time.
Now Xúzhōu is surrounded by enemies.\NIt is bound to suffer disaster.
General, you should first think of a way to fall back.
General, better to move your\Nprovisions and economy to Xiàpī.
That way, if Xúzhōu happens to fall,\NXiàpī will be able to supply you.
General, act on this plan as soon as you can.
Yuánlóng, your words are utmostly correct.
Sòng Xiàn and Wèi Xù!
Here!
I want you two to move the provisions and\Ntransfer them to Xiàpī as soon as you can.
And bring my family as well!
Yes!
Yuánlóng!
Here.
Follow me to reinforce Xiāo pass.
Heed my orders!
General!
Let me go to Xiāo pass first and\Nhear what's sham and what's not from the Cáo army.
Then you may advance, General.
So this is even better!
General, I will depart now.
Xiāo Pass
Our lord resents you for not advancing.\NHe will come here to admonish you.
Their army is mighty, and\Nwe cannot underestimate them.
My army is here to guard the pass.\NI would rather die than lose it!
You may return and inform our lord to\Nguard Xiǎopèi himself. That is the best plan.
Yes.
Wait.
You mustn't persuade our lord\Nto go along with a plan to abandon the city.
Yes.
Someone's firing arrows from the wall!
My lord?
Chén Dēng pays his deepest respects to Lord Cáo.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xiāo pass.
Tomorrow night, I will start a fire on the city walls,
playing a strategy that will cause Lǚ Bù and
Chén Gōng to kill each other.
Sire, you then can take the pass and reach Xúzhōu.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xúzhōu.
If Lǚ Bù loses, he'll try to retreat to Xúzhōu,
but my father and Mí Zhú\Nhave already seized control of it.
Sire, you can receive their surrender.
This letter will help you, sire, seize Xiǎopèi.
I will first lure Gāo Shùn and\NZhāng Liáo out of Xiǎopèi,
Sire, you can exploit this and invade it,
then Xiǎopèi will belong to you, sire!
Good!
Good!
Chén Yuánlóng is within fierce and bellowing waves,
but toyed with it all!
Good!
General-
Of Xiāo pass?
Had I not went there,\Nit would've been in danger.
亏我前往 否则危矣
Sūn Guān and company dreaded the ferocity of\NCáo's army and wished to surrender the pass.
I have left Chén Gōng to guard it.
General, at night, you ought to reinforce them.
Return to Xiāo pass first and inform\NChén Gōng to prevent sedition.
At evening, I shall aid him.
Signal us using a torch and have\NChén Gōng kill the rebels from within.
Yes.
Cáo's army took a small road\Nand is outside the pass.
I fear that Xúzhōu will fall. I hope you, Gōngtái,\Nwill lead an army to save it.
Charge!
Xiāo Pass
Kill!
Charge!
What are you...
We were deceived! Hurry and save Xúzhōu!
Go!
Xúzhōu
Open the gates!
I am Lǚ Bù!
Lǚ Bù! You stole my lord's city!\NNow you ought to return it to him!
Where is Chén Dēng's father?!
Of him? We already killed him!
Mí Zhú\NStyled: Zǐzhòng
Where is Chén Dēng?!
Chén Dēng!
Chén Dēng!
My lord! We already fell for Chén Dēng's dirty trick!
Chén Dēng! Chén Dēng-
My lord! We have to go and save Xiǎopèi now!
Chén Dēng!
Why aren't you guarding Xiǎopèi? Why come here?
Chén Dēng reported that you were surrounded,\Nso we came to save you!
Chén Dēng! I swear I will kill you!
Go!
Xiǎopèi
Chén Dēng!
Evil traitor!
Evil traitor!
Evil traitor!
My lord! Retreat now to Xiàpī!
Fine... go!
Charge!
Xiàpī
Lady Yán
My lady, cheers.
General, you mustn't be too angry.
Chén Dēng betrayed you by relinquishing the city. That is detestable.
But think about it,
if it weren't for Yuánlóng urging you to move to Xiàpī,
Today... this wine would-
A woman's opinion!
If it weren't for Chén Dēng's plan,
then how could I lose Xiāo Pass and Xiǎopèi?
And how then could Xúzhōu\Nfall into the hands of others so easily?
It is better to... use another strategy then.
倒不如使其计呀
Before then, you've blamed Chén Gōng.\NNow, you blame Chén Dēng.
General, whom among the living\Nare you angry with?
I am just a woman. How could I know?
Of these matters, you shouldn't discuss them!
Prepare more wine and food.
Let's invite Chén Gōng and, together,\Nwe can remove our worries from our minds.
