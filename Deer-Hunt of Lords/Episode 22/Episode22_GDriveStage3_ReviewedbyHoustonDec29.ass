Episode 22
The Battle of Guāndù (2)
My childhood friend, I never thought we'd meet like this!
I failed to pick the better lord, \Nas I was under that wicked Yuán Shào.
My words ignored and my ideas disregarded, \NI chose to abandon him.
That's why I've come to an old friend, \Nand I hope I can be of service!
How brilliant! How brilliant! With your arrival,
the blessing of heaven is now mine.
Zǐyuǎn, what plan did you have for me to be defeat Yuan?
I had told Yuan Shao to target Xudu, your most precious territory,
and attack you from both front and rear.
If Yuan Shao followed your plan, \NI would have been destroyed.
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
How much grain is there left in your camp?
We could manage for a year.
Xǔ Yōu\NStyled: Zǐyuǎn
Surely not.
I'm only jesting. We've only got half a year left.
Ziyuan, what are you trying to do?
Come back! Sit down, Ziyuan!
I honestly came to defect,
but you've deceived me so. \NYou have really disappointed me.
Let's not lie to each other.
The grain in the camp is only enough for three months.
Ziyuan, why are you laughing?
Many have said you are \Ndevious, and it is really so, now!
Don't you know war is war?
You may not leak this.
We've only got one month of grain left.
Don't you lie to me! You're already out of grain.
How did you know that?
You sent someone towards Xǔdū to urge the grain shipments.
The letter fell into my hands.
Since you already know the truth,
I humbly ask for your strategy against Yuán's plan.
Chancellor?
Away! Nobody will enter my tent without my orders!
Yes...
Esteemed lord, you fight with a lone army against a vast enemy.
Mm-hmm.
Why didn't you ask a plan for a quick victory?\N Is that not a path to suicide?
Whatever you want to say, Ziyuan, please say it.
My one plan, in only three days,
could have Yuan Shao's 700,000 man army fall apart on its own.
Would my esteemed lord like to hear it?
Don't be like that!
Whatever you wish to say, I will heed it.
I know well that my esteemed lord excels at war,
and that he's surely knows what's critical in defeating an opponent.
Sever his supply route?
Severing his supply route is like choking his throat.
But to defeat Yuan Shao, you only need to cut him from what he needs.
It might not be possible to lay a death-trap, though.
Ziyuan, there is no need to beat around the bush.
Just say it.
Yuan Shao's 700,000-man army relies on its provisions.
All of it is stored in Wūcháo. You only need to attack it.
But if that's the critical point, then \NYuan Shao will surely guard it heavily.
How could we take it feasibly?
I say we can beat Yuan Shao in three days because of this.
Although Wūcháo is very important,\N Yuan Shao views it very lightly.
He actually sent Chúnyú Qióng to garrison it.
That Chunyu Qiong is a careless drunkard,
so isn't that nearly handing Wūcháo\N over to you, esteemed lord?
May I ask, Ziyuan, how should our army seize Wūcháo?
It's not hard! Just select elite cavalry
to disguise themselves as the Yuan officer Jiǎng Qí,
and then go towards Wūcháo to \N'protect' it whilst burning its supplies.
Thus, the Yuan army will be in disarray for three days.
Good. I'll go to Wūcháo personally!
Chancellor, seizing supplies is risky! \NYou should not lead the attack!
Xǔ Chǔ\NStyled: Zhòngkāng
If the Chancellor personally attacks, a mishap may occur! Please reconsider!
The validity of Xǔ Yōu's plan is still unknown! \NYou should not be so trusting!
Wūcháo is Yuan Shao's granary. \NHow could he not defend it?
Xu You may be duplicitous. Do not go.
Moreover, how could 5,000 men beat\N Chunyu Qiong’s tens of thousands?
Report!
Chancellor, 5,000 elite soldiers have been assembled and are ready!
Excellent.
Chancellor!
How is this good?
Wūcháo, for Yuan Shao,
is where his crucial supplies lies.
Raiding his supplies is
where victory or defeat lies for me.
Xu You's defection is Heaven's will helping me defeat Yuan.
Our supplies are gone, and\N remaining would prove difficult.
If we do not use Xu You's plan, it is no different than waiting for death.
Moreover, raiding the supplies
was what I had in mind anyway. Gentlemen, do not doubt it!
If you go, I fear Yuan Shao will exploit this feint to attack!
My plan has been decided!
Please, Chancellor, give the order!
When dusk parts, we shall head towards Wūcháo.
Yes!
Relay my orders!
Raise a fire on all sides! We shall kill them all together!
Yes!
Chúnyú Qióng\NStyled: Zhòngjiān
What's the commotion?
General, look! Wūcháo is on fire!
Wūcháo is attacked! Have the generals rescue the provisions!
Everyone, follow me!
Yes!
Reporting! Suī Yuánjìn and Zhào Ruì\N led troops to attack us from behind!
Generals, just keep charging forward with all your strength!
Deal with them when they get behind us! Now onward!
Chancellor, Yuan's troops are already here!
Rearguard, turn and fight to the death! Force your way through!
Yes!
My lord, Wūcháo is in flames!
Yuán Shào\NStyled: Běnchū
Gāo Lǎn
My lord, Zhāng Hé and I are willing to rescue it!
My lord, no! If they're seizing the supplies, then Cáo Cāo must be there himself.
Guō Tú\NStyled: Gōngzé
In his absence, his camp must be empty!
We should send troops to attack their camp!
Upon hearing of this, Cao Cao will rush there!
His troops will be exhausted. Thus we can crush him, and inflict a great loss!
This is Sūn Bìn's 'Siege Wèi to rescue Zhào' strategy!
Sūn Bìn is suggested sieging Wèi to distract the troops attacking Zhào, thus rescuing it.
Reasonable!
Wrong! Cao Cao is full of strategies; if he left camp, then he has made arrangements already!
If we attack the camp and fail,
when they return from Wūcháo, \Nwe'll be caught in a pincer attack!
That would only exasperate our situation!
Cao Cao only cares about larceny. \NHow could he spare troops for his camp?
Please! My lord, make your \Nchoice now, and raid their camp!
My lord! Wūcháo is more important!
Both of your plans...
you two...
My lord!
Your words are...
within logic.
Zhang He and Gāo Lǎn!
Here!
Lead 5,000 men towards \NGuāndù and raid their camp!
Yes!
Order Jiang Qi to take 10,000 men towards Wūcháo!
General,
were you sober last night?
If you are indeed sober, raise your eyes and see
that {\i1}this{\i0} is your heavily guarded Wūcháo.
It's just as Ziyuan said:
How could Wūcháo not be lost \Nwhen Yuan Shao sent you to defend it?
Men?
Here!
Tattoo Chunyu Qiong's face and body.
Let him go back to Yuan Shao to humiliate him!
Yes!
Have all regiments disguise as Chunyu Qiong's \Ndefeated soldiers and rush back to Guāndù!
If any come to save Wūcháo, kill them along the way.
Yes!
Xiàhóu Yuān\NStyled: Miàocái
General, if we go any further, I fear \Nwe'll be recognized by the Yuan troops!
Which group are you from?
We're Chunyu Qiong's subordinates.
We were defeated by Cao Cao's forces!
Jiǎng Qí
Hurry! Onward to Wūcháo!
Jiang Qi, halt!
We surrender! We surrender!
Send men to disguise as Jiang Qi's \Nsubordinates to Yuan Shao's main camp.
Just say Jiang Qi has already defeated our forces and recovered Wūcháo.
Yes!
Hurry back to Guāndù!
Lift your head for me.
My lord...
What's that on your face?
Words...
What words?
My lord...!
Talk!
It is... the Drunkard of Wūcháo!
You drunk? You drunk!?
I'll let you drink your fill!
Men!
Here!
Take him away!
Drown him in wine!
My lord!
Let him drink his fill!
My lord! My lord!
Report!
Speak!
My lord, General Jiang Qi sent a messenger!
He's already defeated the Cao troops at Wūcháo, and recaptured it!
Then... then... then what about Guāndù?
Zhang He and Gao Lan are currently attacking it.
The results are unclear.
Then... then more troops to Guāndù!
You must take Guāndù!
Yes!
How is the battle?
It's just as Zhang He said.
Zhang He and Gao Lan's persistent attack failed.
Cao Cao got them from behind.
Where are Zhang He and Gao Lan now?
According to defeated troops, they broke out with a hundred or so cavalry.
Their current location is unknown.
If they return,
how could our lord not want to blame you?
Did those two survive?
Yes.
How fares Guāndù?
It is not going well!
It is not going well?
Well, if it is like that, does Cao Cao have an elite force at Guāndù?
What happened?
My lord, are you still unaware of this?
Guāndù had small defenses,
but Zhang He and Gao Lan had no will to fight!
What are you saying?
Those two have long wanted to surrender!
They intentionally refused to fight!
Oh how this enrages me!
Bad news! Bad news!
What's going on?
Zhāng Hé
Master Guō Tú sent me to report this to you!
Our lord is furious!
Gāo Lǎn
He said you two didn't even try to fight.
What!
He wants you killed and shown to the entire army!
Who said we didn't fight as expected?
This is an emergency, so I wouldn't dare remain here!
Farewell!
Your intentions are just as I said!
We have been fighting with all our might!
In the end, it has come to this!
Our Lordship's messenger has arrived!
I need to see the two generals.
Generals, our lord has asked you two to return to camp now.
Why has our lord summoned us?
I don't know.
I really don't know!
You don't know?!
General don't!
Yuan Shao often listens to slander.
He will be defeated sooner or later.
How could we sit and wait for death?
Better to surrender to Cao Cao!
By the Chancellor's orders,
Zhang He and Gao Lan may enter the camp!
Chancellor...
The surrendering general is the one at Guāndù who
matched against Zhāng Liáo in a fifty-bout duel, Zhang He!
I must go out to meet them personally.
Chancellor,
Zhang He and Gao Lan's true intentions in defecting are unknown.
Should you really meet them?
I shall treat them graciously.
If they possess ulterior motives, I will change their heart.
Chancellor!
Generals, since you've come from afar to join me,
you have gained my respect.
Chancellor!
Please rise.
You generals joining me is like \NMaster Wēi leaving Yīn and Hán Xìn joining Hàn.
Dian Wei's(?) departure and the arrival of Han Xin allowed the Han name to rise in the Qin regime about 400 year prior.
Now now, please rise.
Please rise.
Beat him!
And for anyone else who spreads rumors and disturbs morale,
beat them!
Yuán Tán\NStyled: Xiǎnsī
Beat him!
Beat him!
Who's there?
Father, it's me.
It is you.
What are you doing here instead \Nof staying in your camp?
Father,
a few defeats won't decide our fate.
Father, I know you're upset, but you cannot drink!
Xu You left.
Zhang He and Gao Lan have betrayed me!
Right now, the people are aggrieved!
My lord!
My lord! He died! He died!
What?
You scumbag!
Men!
Here!
Have this ill-tongued bastard taken away!
And flog him 300 times!
Yes!
My lord! My lord! Spare–
Afterwards, ask him who died!
Father!
Scumbag! Scumbag! I want him beaten!
Spare my life!
Father!
Beat him!
Father!
Beat him!
Beat him!
Beat him!
We are falling apart, not due to \Nthe enemy, but due to ourselves.
What did you say?
Father, you should rest now for your own good.
My lord, I've discovered someone else \Nwho seeks to disturb our military's morale.
An officer in the rear camp said to someone,
"At the rate things are going, it won't take long
for us to be defeated by Cao Cao."
You heard that clearly?
I heard every word and sentence.
Seize and execute that man!
I want to show his body to the entire army! Anyone else who disturbs morale,
anyone else who spreads rumors, I'll kill them myself!
Yes!
Come back!
My lord?
You must ensure our units are on guard.
This is most important to our military's morale.
Yes, yes!
You!
Generals,
we must defeat the Yuan forces this night!
Charge in from every direction!
Mister Tián Fēng!
Tián Fēng\NStyled: Yuánhào
Sir, why are you here?
Mister Tian, my utmost felicitations for you!
Why are you congratulating me?
General Yuan is returning from a massive defeat!
700,000 troops and soldiers were all killed!
In the beginning, you, sir, urged \Nour lordship not to raise a large army too early!
Now it has come true! Our lordship is returning!
Will you not be reappointed to a higher position?
Mister Tian, what is the matter?
I will die soon.
Mister Tian Feng!
What are you saying?
General Yuan seems open but he's really envious
and does not consider honest advice.
If he wins, then he is pleased, and I would still live.
Now that he suffered a massive defeat, \Nhe will be embarrassed to see me.
Thus I do not hope to survive!
Mister Tian Feng, that...
Out of the way!
What's the matter?
By our Lord's orders, we shall take Tian Feng's head!
Mister Tian Feng!
Chancellor, Yuan Shao only had 800 remaining cavalry to escape!
This is Heaven's will! They are\N doomed to have an arduous escape!
Master Jǔ Shòu?
Master Ju Shou!
Jǔ Shòu
Master Ju Shou.
Hurry. Release this gentleman.
Yes!
I would never ever surrender!
Yuan Benchu* had no plans and never used thy words.
*Yuan Shao
Why the fervor for the ignorant?
Had I gotten you earlier, I would have no worries over the whole world.
Sir, you have the talent of a hero, but could not find a wise lord.
I value your knowledge and talent, and I would like to plan great things with you.
I would like to receive your teachings often.
Build a tomb for Master Ju on the banks of the Yellow River.
Chancellor, see this!
What are you so rattled about?
Chancellor, many people within Xǔdū secretly communicated with Yuan Shao.
In these letters, the most sycophantic language was used.
This actually happened?
Chancellor,
Chancellor, now that you've seen the letters, please get their names,
arrest them, and kill them.
Have them torched.
Yes!
Chancellor?
Chancellor, what are you doing?
That was when Yuán Shào was powerful
and I couldn't even protect myself...
...How did they feel?
Chancellor.
The elders have come to offer wine to the Chancellor!
Chancellor!
Chancellor, during the reign of Emperor Huán,
there were people that predicted that after 50 years,
a certain benevolent man would climb here.
From today, 50 years have passed!
Yuan Shao has burdened his people, and thus they all dislike him.
Chancellor, you raised a most righteous host
to relieve their suffering. And in the battle of Guāndù,
you defeated the hundred-thousand hordes of the Yuan.
This is what was said 50 years ago.
It's a sign that the people may now look forward to peace!
Yes! Yes!
I can't possibly receive this boon!
Chancellor, we were born in the yellow earth and will drink of the yellow water
until we are a hundred years old.
How could I speak so carelessly to the great river?
Yes!
Chancellor, please!
If so, forgive your junior for acting on his own,
but I shall offer to this earth the wine and this water
to nurture such kindness as yours for ten thousand years.
