White Gate Tower (Part 2)
Fèngxiān?
Lǚ Bù\NStyled: Fèngxiān
Chancellor.
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
Fengxian,
I have led my armies here
not to take Xú Province, but for\Nyour benefit, General. That is all!
I heard you, Fengxian, were going to send\Nyour daughter to Yuán Shù for a marriage,
but that Yuan Shu declared himself Emperor.
That is treason most heinous!
And you, sir, helped against\N Dǒng Zhuō, earning glory!
Why would you forsake your honor\Nto bend yourself to a traitor?
If Xiàpī falls, your regrets will be too late!
Better to surrender and\Nhelp us support the House of Hàn!
You won't lose your Marquis rank!
Fengxian, consider this!
Chancellor.
Withdraw first, then we may talk. How about that?
Rotten traitor!
Chén Gōng \NStyled: Gōngtái
Who do you think you are!?
I know what you are!\NA wolf in sheep's clothing!
See my arrow!
Xiàpī
Gōngtái! What are you doing?!
Chén Gōng, I swear I will kill you!
Gongtai, why do you despise Cáo Cāo that much?!
Cao Cao came from afar and\Nhe cannot maintain this course for long.
General, you can lead the garrison outside the city,
Me and the remainder will guard it.
If Cao Cao were to attack you,
I will lead an army to attack their rear.
If he attacks the city, General,\N{\i1}you{\i0} can strike their rear.
Both ways will get them between ox-horns, so to speak.
In ten days, his army will run out of\Nprovisions and would naturally fallback.
That way, you can again be on the offensive.
In one beat, you can rout the Cao army!
According to your words, Gongtai...
My lord!
It's cold. Order men to bring more cotton clothes.
Xiàpī
Hurry! In formation!
It's Chen Gong.
Husband, how could you abandon us and your own men?
If something unexpected happens, would I then still be your wife?
Form up!
My lord, please give an order.
Form up!
General, you've hesitated for three days already.
Though we are besieged, they haven't broken through.
If we hesitate, thus trapping us,\Nit will be too late!
General!
General!
General, you can't go!
Lady Yán
Can Gāo Shùn and Chen Gong really defend Xiàpī?
If there is a flaw, it will be too late for regrets!
I'm only going out to cut off Cao Cao's supply lines.
When I was at Cháng'ān, you abandoned me there.
It was fortunate we could later meet again.
But today, you want to abandon me again!
General!
My lord, hurry! Go!
General!
Rather than leave the city, it would\Nbe more feasible to defend it.
My lord, I have another plan.
I heard Cao's army has limited supplies,
so he's sent men to Xǔdū for more.\NSoon or later, they will arrive.
General, you ought to lead your most elite to cut off their lines.
This is a brilliant plan. I beseech you,\NGeneral, to make a decision now.
Cao Cao has many tricks and has always been good at breaking supply lines.
How could he not defend his own supply lines?
I cannot act rashly now.
We will die without a place to be buried at!
General, why not go out and ask Yuan Shu?
Xǔ Sì
Wáng Kǎi
Yuan Shu is in Huáinán; if you manage to get to him, propose a marriage alliance-
Correct! Yuan Shu can send troops to save us.
Your families should unite for a pincer attack. \NCao's army will be easy to rout!
Who?
My lord.
Xǔ Sì? Wáng Kǎi?
General!
Has anyone else been here?
The two left the city.
It's been several days.
Why is there no news from them?
General!
Since yesterday, Xu Si and Wang Kai have returned.
You've recently been of an inconstant mind\Nand have sighed often.
You drink to remove the fears,
and there is not a word nor reply from you whenever I speak.
General, you are so depressed.
As your wife, it's too painful to look on.
It's not that I won't talk... it's really...
it's really that my subordinates won't let me tell you!
What?
A few days ago, Xu Si and Wang Kai\Ncame in and said to me,
"Now Yuan Shu resides in Huáinán, his power booming."
"Since we had entered talks of a\Nmarriage alliance previously,"
"and considering our situation now,\Nwhy not ask again?"
You!
"This time, Yuan Shu will send reinforcements\Nour way so that we may do a pincer attack."
"Then Cao Cao will not be difficult to rout!"
Under this did I agree.
But this is too much!
General, you listen to others, yet never tell me anything!
General! Xu Si and Wang Kai have returned\Nfrom Shòuchūn and are already here!
General?
General?
Speak now!
Yes.
Below his city, we met Yuan Shu\Nand presented the letter from you.
Because you, sir, had killed Yuan Shu's envoys,
he declined our proposal.
Now that we have came to ask of it again,
he has blamed you, sir, for your chronic treachery.
He added that if it weren't for the Cao's army besiegement, and the crisis of Xiàpī,
how could you marry your daughter off?
This time, only when you first send your daughter
will he be willing to relieve us.
But how can I send her?
Our enemies have besieged the city on all sides.
When we went,
had it not been for Zhāng Liáo and Gao Shun, we wouldn't have broken through Liu Bei's camp!
Otherwise, we would've been\Nghosts before Shòuchūn!
During return, General Hǎo Méng broke from the rear
but was captured by\NZhāng Fēi and given to Cao Cao!
They know our situation,\Nhence we ought to be ready.
As your lowly servant sees it, unless... unless...
What!
Unless you will escort your daughter personally,
who else can break out of the siege?
What!
How could you think of this?
I will escort her today, how about it?
Today has the aura of devils; we cannot leave now!
Tomorrow is auspicious,\Nand you should leave at night.
Fine!
Tomorrow, it's tomorrow!
Lǚ Bù's\Ndaughter
Mother!
Mother!
The Chancellor's orders. If anyone lets\NLü Bu escape, they shall be killed on the spot!
Charge!
Don't cry! Don't cry!
Father!
Father!
How could this happen to {\i1}me?!
The Adminstrator of Hénèi;\NZhāng Yáng sent troops east
to reinforce Lü Bu, but his subordinate, Yáng Chǒu, killed him.
Zhang Yang may be gone, but there is\NYuán Shào in the north to be concerned of.
In the east is Liú Biǎo and Zhāng Xiù, too.
Xiàpī has resisted for a long time.
We should abandon siege,\Nreturn to the capital, and negotiate.
Gentlemen, what do you think?
Chancellor, you absolutely should not do this!
Lü Bu suffered repeated defeats\Nand his morale has fallen.
An army's will depends on their leader.\NWhen their will has fallen, the army's spirit falls.
As of now, Lü Bu has not recovered;
Chén Gōng cannot decide on a plan.
Sir, if you exploit this to intensify\Nyour attack on Xiàpī, Lü Bu will be captured.
I have a single plan to break through Xiàpī,
able to take on over 200,000 soldiers.
Perhaps you mean using
the Yí and Sì rivers to inundate Xiàpī?
That was my intention.
Flood it.
Report! General, Cao Cao flooded the city!
Report! General! The Southern and Northern\Ngates have been flooded!
Report!
General, Eastern gate of Xiàpī is intact!
All the others are flooded!
I have Red Hare, who can cross waters\Nas if they were fields.
What do I have to fear?
My lady, cheers.
Look at me, so disheveled and haggard, all because of wine...
General!
Starting today...
No more wine!
Men! Pass my orders. Starting today,
anyone who drinks will meet execution!
Yes sir!
Hurry! Hurry! Secure the area!
We need to keep this place secure! Hurry, go!
Gongtai.
Gongtai!
Pass my orders! Starting today,
anyone who drinks will be beheaded!
Hóu Chéng
General!
Why didn't you go to the walls and reinforce them,\Nrather coming here instead?
General, our fifteen stolen horses have been recovered!
Good.
Good.
It is only for your might that I was able to recover them!
The generals have come to congratulate me with wine. I wouldn't dare keep it for myself!
My might?
I had just banned alcohol, but you gather your cohorts to drink!
Perhaps you are working against me with Cao Cao?!
A ban on alcohol?
General!
Men!
Here!
Execute him!
Yes sir!
General, lower the knife for a good man!
Sòng Xiàn
Wèi Xù
For your sake, I will only give him a hundred beatings!
General, we are facing a strong foe!\NWe need everyone we have!
My lord!
So you two do know that we are facing a terrible foe, right?!
In that case, I will take off fifty beatings!
He'll be beaten fifty times\Nso that you two stop crowing!
General!
Sòng Xiàn, I owe my very life to you...
Lü Bu only cares about his women and treats us like weeds!
Now that Cáo's army has besieged us with water, we are close to being dead!
Lü Bu is not benevolent nor just.\NHow about we desert and go elsewhere?
Desert? That would be an act of a coward!
Better to capture Lü Bu and\Nsurrender to Lord Cao!
Capture Lü Bu and take him to Lord Cao?
Lü Bu relies on his mount, Red Hare!
You two can surrender the city\Nafter capturing that traitor.
I will be the one stealing the horse for Lord Cao.
You take the horse. Wèi Xù and I will pretend to chase you down.
Today we capture Xiàpī! Charge!
Cao Cao, from dawn, assaulted the city until noon.
Lü Bu's army suffered countless casualties.
Cao's army withdrew temporarily \Nand Lü Bu stationed himself on the city tower.
What are you... what are you doing?
What are you doing?!
We have captured Lü Bu!
Traitor!
Bastard!
White Gate \NTower
Follow me up.
My lord, please.
Chancellor!
It's too tight!
It's too tight!
It's too tight!
How can one bind a tiger loosely?
I never belittled you.
Why rebel against me?
You only heed your wife's words,\N and never your officers. What do {\i1}you{\i0} think?
You punish your subordinates at will,\Nand you ask why rebel?
Lü Bu,
now that you're here.\NWhat can you say for yourself?
My lord, you seem to have become thinner recently...
Fengxian, had I not bound you,\Nthen how could I rest assured?
Gāo Shùn
Do you have any words?
Hang him, then behead him.
Go!
Gongtai, have you been well since we last met?
When you left my service,\Ndid you ever expect this to happen?
I left your service because of your crooked ways.
My "crooked ways"?
Can you explain why you served Lü Bu alone?
Lü Bu, despite his lack of wisdom,
does not resemble you in such deceit and treachery.
You claim to be full of wisdom and wit,
but just how did you fall into such a predicament?
All I regret is that the man didn't heed my words.
Had he listened, we would not\Nhave been captives then.
Gongtai, that...
So then,
Gongtai, what do you think ought to happen today?
Today, there is death for me, and that is all!
Sir, naturally you would prefer death,
but what will happen to your mother, wife, and children?
I heard that those who rule with regard to filial piety do not harm one's family.
One who practices benevolence\Ncannot cut off the sacrifices at one's tomb.
Now my family is in your hands. That is all.
Gongtai!
Now that I'm captured, go ahead. I will die without regret.
Gongtai?
Gongtai!
Gongtai?
Gongtai!
I abandoned my magistrate post\Nto follow you, sir, to achieve great deeds.
"I'd rather let myself betray the world\Nthan let the world betray me."
Escort Gongtai's family to Xǔdū so that they may be looked after.
Anyone who delays will meet with death.
Sir, you are the guest; I am a prisoner.
Why not save us both?
Liú Bèi\NStyled: Xuándé
My lord.
My lord, you only worry about me, that is all,
but now, I am willing to serve you, my lord.
Sire, you take the lead; I will assist you.
Why worry about the unruly world then?
Lord Xuándé, how do you feel about this?
Sire, do you remember the fates of\NDīng Yuán and Dǒng Zhuō?
What...?!
Sire, do you remember {\i1}the fates of\NDīng Yuán and Dǒng Zhuō?
Guards.
Here!
Hang him.
Then cut his head off.
Liu Bei! You traitorous bastard!
There is no one with less principle than you!
Liu Bei! Did you forget how I saved you when\Nshooting that arrow through my halberd?!
An arrow through my halberd-
Zhāng Liáo\NStyled: Wényuǎn
Lü Bu!
You coward! It is but only death! Why be afraid?
This man looks familiar...
We met each other at Púyáng City.\NHow could you forget?
So you remember as well...
It's only a pity!
What pity?
It's only a pity that the fire that day\N wasn't big enough to roast you to death.
Sire.
Sire, don't kill him.
He is a man of honor and loyalty.
Sire, let him live to do justice.
I have long known Wényuǎn for his virtue.
I will plead for him with my life.
How couldn't I have heard of Wenyuan's good name?
I was merely jesting, that is all.
In the 3rd year of the Jiàn'ān era,\Nthe winter of 198 CE,
Cao Cao finally fulfilled his wish\N by wiping out the trouble within his heart, Lü Bu,
and receiving Zhang Liao's surrender.
The General of Chariots and Cavalry,\NChē Zhòu, controlled Xú-Province.
Ever since, Cao Cao's power has grown\Nstronger, and his prestige has amassed.
