Episode 11
Battle of Wǎnchéng
Sir!
What brings your esteemed presence here today?
Chén Guī
General, I heard your death is soon coming.
I've come to give my condolences.
Lǚ Bù\NStyled- Fèngxiān
Sir?
Why do you speak thus?
I'm just saying, my lord,
you...!
Not long ago, when Lord Yuán sent you gold, silk, and fine rice,
his true purpose was to bribe you to eliminate Liú Xuándé!
But you, sir, shot an arrow through your\Nhalberd to shut the issue down.
Now today, he has come to propose a marriage!
Intending to..?
He intends to take your daughter hostage!
Afterwards, he will come to attack Liú Bèi\Nand snatch Xiǎopèi from you.
If Xiǎopèi falls, then Xú province will...
Be in peril?
We would be done for...
This is the strategy of 'isolating a family'.
'Isolating a family'?
In the future, Yuán Shù may come to ask for grain,
or he will ask us for troops.
If you were to accept,
he will surely exhaust your supplies.
If you were to decline,
there will be strife amongst your "family".
That would be abandoning your\Nrelatives and inviting hostilities.
Regardless, I was told that Yuán Shù\Nhad intentions to declare himself emperor.
That is an act of insurrection!
If you ally with him and he rebels,
then you, General, will be a relative of a traitor!
How could the world tolerate you then?
Chén Gōng misled me!
Men!
Here!
Get Zhāng Liáo after them now!
I must get my daughter {\i1}back!
Yes sir!
General Zhāng! You must return my daughter!
Yes, sir!
Zhāng Fēi, you thief!\NLeave the horses you've stolen !
General, the horses we bought were stolen!
Who did this?! The audacity!
I found out he is Liú Bèi's brother, Zhāng Fēi!
Large-eyed brute!\NHe's terrorized me too much!
Muster the troops!
Zhāng Fēi, I will fight you and\Nsee who's superior and inferior!
Liú Bèi\NStyled - Xuándé
My brother, why did you lead your troops here?
I shot an arrow through my halberd, saving you,
but now you steal my horses!
Well, we needed horses.
I sent people to purchase them!
How could I ever steal your horses?
You ordered your brother Zhāng Fēi to be a bandit!
Half my horses from Shāndōng are gone!
You dare deny this?
Zhāng Fēi\NStyled - Yìdé
I stole your horses! \NWhat're you gonna do about it?
Large-eyed brute!\NYou dare to slight me?!
Getting angry over a few stolen horses.
What about my brother's land which you stole?!
Hurry! Sound the retreat signal!
My lord!
What is it?
We have returned all of the horses.
Sūn Qián\NStyled - Gōngyòu
But that Lǚ Bù...
Bastard of three fathers!
Guān Yǔ\NStyled - Yúncháng
Elder Brother, Xiǎopèi can only last so long from Lǚ Bù's assaults.
Cáo Cāo despises Lǚ Bù the most.
Even though sire has already returned the horses,
yet Lǚ Bù still won't withdraw.
As I see it, it would be better to abandon Xiǎopèi,
go to Xǔdū, and seek shelter under Cáo Cāo.
We could ask for troops \Nand defeat Lǚ Bù later!
Why need aid from Cáo Cāo?
Brother, I'm not scared of that Lǚ Bù!
Silence!
You! You always end up causing unneeded trouble!
Elder Brother, you...!
Third Brother, we told you to stop drinking!
Second Brother, are you against me as well?
This isn't wine, it's water!
First it's Lǚ Bù, now we kneel to Cáo Cāo!
You may be able to endure it, but I can't take it anymore!
Who'll lead the vanguard and break the siege?
The sin is mine. I will give my life to get through!
My beloved brother...
We all know that you are a just and frank man,
and that you hate erratic and\Ndishonest people like Lǚ Bù.
Don't you think I feel the same?
But when a true man acts in troubled times,
they must be open-minded and upright.
In the face of adversity, we must bow to others and wait for the right time to rise again.
You can't oppose our fate.
At the third watch, we'll break out from the Northern Gate.
Yìdé, be the vanguard; Yúncháng, guard the rear.
Sūn Qián, Mí Zhú, and I will be in the middle,\Nprotecting our families.
Yes!
We shall obey you!
Cáo Cāo\NStyled - Mèngdé
Ah, Lord Xuándé, I assume\Nyou've been well since we last met?
We've come to seek shelter.\NI'm ashamed to ask it from you.
Ah, what are you saying, Xuándé?
You and I are like brothers.
Third Brother.
Come!
Lǚ Bù is one of the most wicked men. \NHe won't achieve anything.
I ought to punish him alongside you!
Today's banquet will help ease\Nyour pain from losing your land!
Please?
Please.
My Lord, Liú Bèi is one of \Nmany ambitious men in the world.
If we don't eliminate him now, he will become a nuisance.
Wénruò, you conceived the ideas of 'two tigers competing for food'
and 'driving the tiger to devour the wolf'.
All this effort, wasn't it all because of him?
Now this tiger was defeated and has come to us.
My Lord, you only need one phrase to eliminate Liú Bèi;
why even plan?
My Lord?
Ah, Fèngxiào!
Fèngxiào, Xún Yù advised me to kill Xuándé.\NWhat do you think about this?
Do not.
Why is that?
Liú Bèi is ambitious too.\NIf he lives, isn't he going to stir trouble?
My Lord, your army has a righteous cause to rid all ills.
Only your integrity will lure prodigies;\Nthe lack thereof will repel them.
Xuándé has made quite a name for himself.
Now he has come to you in great peril.
To kill him would be to do harm upon a virtue!
Talents across the realm will be fearful\Nand will hesitate to join you.
Who else would you rely on\Nto pacify the realm then, My Lord?
You can eliminate one potentially dangerous person,
but dash the hopes of all within the four seas.
My Lord, you can't be too rash;\Nyou must consider it carefully.
Sir, your words are like my own!
I was just speaking in jest!
Very well. I will make a statement to the court tomorrow
to recommend Liú Bèi as {\i1}Potentate of Yù-Province!
My Lord, don't do it!
My Lord, you mustn't promote Liú Bèi.
Liú Bèi is a champion of the times,\Nnot content to be a subordinate.
Giving him any land would be like caring for a tiger!
In the end, he won't stand being under other men;
better to get rid of him forever!
This tiger cannot be left alone,\Nyet cannot be eliminated either!
This is an era where having heroes is essential.
I can't lose the hearts of them just because I want to kill him!
Guō Fèngxiào's belief is the same I have.
Say no more!
In the 2nd year of the Jiàn'ān era\Nunder Emperor Xiàn,
while Cáo Cāo joined forces\Nwith Liú Bèi to invade Lǚ Bù,
Zhāng Xiù, with Liú Biǎo,\Nstationed troops at the City of Wǎn,
wanting to attack Cáo Cāo and seize power.
On one side, Cáo Cāo attacked Lǚ Bù;
on the other, he led a grand army through three different roads to punish Zhāng Xiù.
Report! Xiàhóu Dūn, vanguard of Cáo Cāo's army,\Nhas set up camp at Yùshuǐ!
Scout again!
Yes sir!
Jiǎ Xǔ\NStyled - Wénhé
General?
Zhāng Xiù
Cáo Cāo is a capable commander.
All civil officials and generals\Nunder his banner are experts in warfare.
Now he's leading 150,000 troops divided in three from three different directions.
This is a testament to his might.\NWe can't possibly face him.
Then, Wénhé,\Nwhat do you think I should do?
With your uncle dead and the\Ninsufficiency of Liú Biǎo's army,
in my modest opinion... the best course of action...
we might as well do him a favor and just surrender.
What?!
So what you are saying...
is that it would be better to be under Cáo Cāo's banner
with my eyes down as {\i1}a defeated enemy general?
That... this is a matter of time and might! A matter of time and might!
A matter of time and might?!
Receive the official seal!
Lead the way for my horse!
Diǎn Wéi
Are there any {\i1}'mistresses' {\i0}within this city?
Dismissed!
Yesterday at night,\Nthrough the side of the chambers,
I saw a married woman, who looked very beautiful.
After asking, they told me she was the wife of Zhāng Jì.
A very beautiful woman...?
However, Zhāng Jì is the uncle of Zhāng Xiù.
Moreover, as he's recently\Nleft this world, I'm afraid—
What about Zhāng Xiù?
He's just a lout who lost.
So what if he gets mad?
Who gives him the right to complain!
Go. Take fifty armed men and bring her.
Go!
Yes.
My Lord, she's here.
May I dare ask for your name, ma'am?
I am the wife of Zhāng Jì, Lady Zōu.
Ma'am, have you've heard of me?
I've long heard of your name, General.\NI am fortunate to meet you tonight.
It was for you that I allowed\NZhāng Xiù to surrender and live.
Otherwise the Zhāng clan\Nwould have been exterminated.
I'm grateful, for I owe my\Nvery life to your kindness.
To finally meet you today, ma'am, is heaven's blessing.
Ma'am, are you willing\Nto share a bed with me tonight?
Being looked after by you, General, is the blessing of three lives.
But if you stay in the city for too long,
Zhāng Xiù will have suspicions, and\NI fear outsiders will begin to gossip.
Tommorow, you will go with me
and dwell in my camp outside the city.
Am I willing to suffer such a big disgrace?\NThis won't do!
General, please calm down!
{\i1}Calm down?
He kidnapped my aunt!
How can I {\i1}stay calm!?
If Cáo Cāo flees the city, he will camp outside.
Then there's his valiant general, Diǎn Wéi,\Nwho acts as his bodyguard.
Nobody else may enter unless stated otherwise.
By restricting access from outside or inside,\Nthey can be on guard.
If you act rashly, the consequences\Nwill be extremely disastrous.
General?
For this matter... you must heed my advice. \NMake sure not to leak it out!
In the following days, that\Nbastard will come out to discuss matters.
General, you need to...
{\fs40.909\}You need to do it like {\i1}this{\i0}, in {\i1}that{\i0} way...
General, why have you called me?
Hú Chē'er.
Yesterday, Cáo Cāo called his\Nofficers to a meeting.
I ordered many of my soldiers\Nto desert en masse.
With that, I was able to situate in the center of his camp.
Do you know my plan?
Hú Chē'er
How could I not know?
That's good.
Though my plan to move troops\Nhasn't made Cáo Cāo suspicious,
there is a man guarding the tent in the camp, Diǎn Wéi.
He is a fearsome warrior, and getting in will be most difficult.
I summoned you to discuss this.
What's fearsome about \NDiǎn Wéi is his twin halberds.
My Lord, invite him tomorrow to have some wine.
Assure he gets really drunk, then have him return. Then—
Then what? What are you going to do?
I'll sneak into the tent and steal his halberds; no need to fear him anymore.
Good. Enact your plan.
Yes.
General, you sure can handle large amounts!
Cheers?
Cheers?
It's late already.
I can't get too drunk.
You're very famous! It's rare to even see you!
Just this once, drink as much as you want!
I must always be by my lord to protect him!
Like a leaf in the wind, I now wander.
{\k99\i1}Wǒ {\k109}běn {\k94}piāo{\k115}líng {\k257}rén.
Born under an unlucky star,\Nmy life has been bitter;
{\k69\i1}Bó{\k139}mìng {\k83}lì {\k144}kǔ{\k165}xīn.
escaping from the chaos, I encountered you.
{\k103\i1}Lì{\k207}luàn {\k104}de {\k103}yù{\k173}jūn.
I am most grateful for\Nyour kindness when we met;
{\k103\i1}Gǎn {\k68}jūn {\k84}píng{\k123}shuǐ {\k362}ēn.
your love brings but temporary happiness.
{\k83\i1}Jūn {\k176}ài {\k109}yī{\k70}shì {\k162}huān.
The beacon signals an auspicious occasion.
{\k74\i1}fēng{\k74}yān {\k83}zuò {\k93}liáng{\k306}chén.
With tears in my eyes for your life,
{\k122\i1}Hán{\k186}leì {\k89}wéi {\k84}jūn {\k119}shòu,
wine conceals the scars of warfare.
{\k41\i1}Jiǔ{\k120}hén {\k104}yǎn {\k89}zhēng{\k246}chén
Dim, so dim is the lamplight;
{\k233\i1}Dēng {\k98}hūn {\k279}hūn
deep, so deep is this tent.
{\k151\i1}Zhàng {\k86}shēn{\k279}shēn
The soft pouring of wine;
{\k210\i1}Jūn {\k117}wàng{\k293}qíng
the soft words spoken.
{\k105\i1}Qiè {\k105}shàng{\k240}shēn
An instant of elation;
{\k14\i1}Yī{\k26}shà {\k95}huān{\k152}xīn
{\i1}an instant of comfort.{\i1}
{\k28\i1}Yī{\k68}shà {\k67}wēn{\k47}xīn
Who will understand the meaning of my verse;{\i1}
{\k97\i1}Míng{\k44}ri {\k53}Yù{\k41}shuǐ {\k135}tóu
who will empathize with the person in this song?{\i1}

My Lord! My Lord!
Your son, Cáo Áng, and nephew, Cáo Ānmín...
we found their bodies!
But General Diǎn Wéi...
General Diǎn Wéi?
Yes.
Where's Diǎn Wéi?!
My Lord!
Hurry! Hurry!
General Yú Jìn... he...
What about Yú Jìn?
Yú Jìn took advantage and rebelled,\Nattacking Xiàhóu Dūn's Qingzhōu Assault Troops!
Note: Qingzhōu Troops were an elite battalion serving under Cao Cao, formed from the remnants of the Yellow Turbans.
He's killed many of our men!
How could this be?
When Yú Jìn heard of my defeat,\Nhe did not come to rescue us.
Instead, he took advantage and rebelled,\Nlike dropping stones on someone stuck in a well.
I will fight him with all I have!
Report!
My Lord!
Yú Jìn led his troops to pursue Zhāng Xiù\Nfor more than 100 lǐ!
He won total victory!
My Lord!
We followed Yú Jìn, who pursued\NZhāng Xiù through several roads.
His strength is exhausted, and he found himself isolated.
The defeated troops have fled to Liú Biǎo!
My Lord!
Yú Jìn,
some men accused you\Nof excessive cruelty and rebellion.
My lord, that—
My lord!
When the Qīngzhōu Troops rebelled,
Why didn't you tell me first \Nbut fight them yourself instead?
Explain.
They were coming rapidly;\Nthere was no time to report it.
My Lord, this affair was never General Yú Jìn's fault!
It is mine; I was too laid back!
The Qīngzhōu Troops started stirring trouble \Nand raided the countryside!
Thereafter, Yú Jìn killed those curs,\Ncalming the people along the way.
Yú Jìn, when you saw me coming your way,
you didn't explain your actions.\NInstead, you prepared for battle.
Explain.
Yú Jìn\NStyled - Wénzé
The rebels were on us. If we didn't prepare,\Nhow could've we fought?
You didn't come to me to explain; did you not fear I'd wrong you?
Explanations are trivial;\N defense is important!
My Lord!
General, even under pressure,\Nyou were able to build a firm base.
You ignored slander and turned defeat into victory.
Even the famed generals of old...
could hardly compare!
My Lord!
Cáo Cāo not only lost his favorite general, Diǎn Wéi,
but also his beloved son and nephew, Cáo Áng and Cáo Ānmín.
Luckily, Yú Jìn and others did their best to aid him
allowing Cáo Cāo to turn defeat into victory and danger into safety.
In the 3rd year of the Jiàn'ān era,\NYuán Shù proclaimed himself Emperor in Huáinán.
When he heard of it,\NCáo Cāo led an army of 170,000 troops,
joining forces with Sūn Cè of Jiāngdōng,
Liú Bèi of Yù-Province, and Lǚ Bù of Xú-Province,
to attack Yuán Shù through three directions.
Seeing himself surrounded by enemies,
Yuán Shú was forced to sail across the Huái River,\Nbringing treasures with him.
He ordered Lǐ Fēng and others to\Ngarrison and defend Shòuchūn to death,
Cáo Cāo was facing another enemy in a prolonged and bloody battle once again.
Please ask Rèn Jùn's subordinate the supplies overseer, Wáng Hòu,
to come to my tent right away.
Yes.
My Lord?
Sit.
Alright.
[PLACEHOLDER]
Out of those 400,000 hú of grain we borrowed from Sūn Cè,
how much are left?
Not that much left.\NThere's barely enough to feed 170,000 men.
Then you need to reduce the rations
for each soldier at the moment.
But if they complain, what to do then?
I will have another solution.
My Lord, even if we reduce the rations,
it's only enough for three days!
Three days?
Yes.
Just do it.
Yes.
Three days?
Three days.
Who's idea was it to reduce rations?!
Why are they taking our food?
Yes!
Speak!
Whose idea was it?!
Whose idea was it?
Speak up!
Beat him up!
My Lord!
My Lord!\NLook what's happening out there!
The soldiers are rioting for the rations!
They're saying that you've cheated them!
My Lord!
My Lord! Please do something!
They'll start a mutiny!
I...
I was thinking of borrowing \Nsomething from you to calm them.
I hope you won't resent me for this.
'Resentment?'
What does My Lordship want to borrow from me?
I...
I want to borrow your head.
What?
My Lord!
I've done nothing wrong! How can you-
I know that you're innocent,
but if I don't kill you, the army will mutiny.
After you die, your wife\Nand children shall be in my care.
You need not worry for them.
My Lord!
Men!
Here!
Wáng Hòu knowingly distributed small rations.
The crime for withholding rations, according to military law, is...
death!
Yes!
It was him, the supplies overseer?
You deserve death!
He deserves death! Kill him now!
My Lord... I bid you farewell.
