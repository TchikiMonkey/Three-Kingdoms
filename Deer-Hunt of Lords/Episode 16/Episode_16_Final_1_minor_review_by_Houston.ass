Episode 16
Guān Yǔ's Three Terms
Zhāng Fēi captured Cáo Cāo's General, Liú Dài, at their camp.
However, Liú Bèi feared Cáo Cāo would return,
so he released Liú Dài and Wáng Zhōng back to Xǔchang.
Furthermore, he ordered Guān Yǔ to protect his wives and to remain at Xiàpī.
Sūn Qián and the others guarded Xú Province\Nwhile Zhāng Fēi guarded Xiǎopèi.
They thus formed an ox-horn defense against Cáo Cāo
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
Dǒng Chéng's servant?
Let him in!
This servant of yours is Qín Qìngtóng.
Chancellor, I and Dǒng Chéng's concubine were talking in the dark.
Dǒng Chéng saw us, suspected us of an affair, and had me beaten.
Qín Qìngtóng
He even wanted to kill me!
I managed to escape the mansion at night!
Chancellor.
Chancellor, Wáng Zǐfú, Wú Zǐlán, Zhǒng Jí, Wú Shuò, and Mǎ Téng
had a secret meeting in the mansion.
It was certainly to murder you, sire!
Dǒng Chéng had some silk to write characters, but did not know what to use as the pen.
Yesterday, Jí Píng and the others bit their fingers to seal their oath.
I had seen it!
I... I saw them... but couldn't what they were writing!
Jí Píng
Chancellor! Chancellor! They had ill intentions!
Perhaps you lied to fulfill your grudge?
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!
You said they bit their fingers for an oath?
Which finger did Jí Píng bite then?
The index finger.
The right index finger!
Chancellor, I'm telling the truth! Please see for yourself!
Thank you, Chancellor!
Why is this medicine so difficult to decoct?
It's ready.
Chancellor, this medicine shall remove your ailment in one serving.
'Remove my ailment'?
Sir, you are an erudite, therefore you must know the etiquette.
I think you should know that \Nwhen the lord needs medicine,
their minister must taste it first;
when the father needs medicine, their son must taste it first.
You happen to be one of my aides.
Why did you not taste it first before entering?
Medicine is meant for treatment. Why have others taste it?
Gentlemen! This banquet is for all and we end only when drunk.
Today, I invited all the important ministers here.
Wáng Zǐfú
How come Dǒng Chéng isn't here? Imperial Uncle Dǒng?
He hasn't arrived yet!
I heard he fell ill recently and couldn't come because of it.
And I heard you, Zǐfú, are a heavy drinker.
Come! I want to have a drinking contest!
With your prowess, I cannot possibly beat you, my lord.
Since you refuse merriment,
I'd like to show an amusement that'd make Zǐfú and the rest of you sober.
Zǐfú, are you sober now?
Dǒng Chéng
Apologies for being unwelcoming.
Last night, why didn't you come to the banquet?
I was still sick, that's the truth.
Perhaps a sickness for our nation?
I heard that the imperial uncle was ill.
As such, I bring to you some special medicine to treat thy illness.
This man has incriminated Wáng Zǐfú \Nand four others. They are now imprisoned. 
There is but one person not yet found and arrested.
Jí Píng?
Who is it that ordered you to poison me?
It is Heaven's will to kill you!
Chancellor, he can't take any more beatings.
Jí Píng, may I ask why your\N right index finger has a wound?
I bit that finger as an oath\Nto kill the traitor of the nation!
And I will order all your fingers cut off.\NWe'll see if you can make any more oaths.
I still have teeth to bite that traitor,
and I still have a tongue to curse that traitor!
Cut his tongue!
Yes!
Chancellor!
Imperial Uncle, please tell me...
where is... the imperial palace?
I wish... to see it one last time... before death!
I was unable to eliminate the traitor for the nation!
Thus is Heaven's fate!
Grand Physician!
Imperial Uncle, perhaps you can recognize this man?
How could I not know?
Shameless drudge! Lecher! Craven deserter!
I should behead you here!
He was the first to leak the plot with his testimony. Who'd dare hurt him?
Chancellor, how could you heed the words of a serf!
Have you found it?
Vermin... you would dare to do such a thing!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty, the Chancellor-
Dǒng Chéng intended to rebel. Was Your Majesty aware?
Dǒng Zhuō is dead
Not Dǒng Zhuō, it is Dǒng Chéng!
I... do not know.
Did you forget your edict?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Take her out. Kill her.
Emperor \NXiàn of Hàn
Concubine Dǒng is with a baby of five-months! I beg of you to spare her.
And leave a traitorous seed to germinate for vengeance?!
Guards, take her away! \NIf she refuses to die herself, hang her.
Yes!
I order Cáo Hóng to lead 3,000 soldiers as\N{\i1}the Imperial Guards{\i0} for the palace.
Henceforth, if any relatives of the Emperor enters the palace without my permission, kill them!
Chancellor, we have Dǒng Chéng and over 700 people under arrest! What shall we do with them?
Kill them all.
Dǒng Chéng and the others may be dead,
but Liú Bèi and Mǎ Téng are also included.
They must be removed!
Mǎ Téng is guarding Xīliáng, and he is not to be trifled with.
We should present him an award to lure him into the capital,
then eliminate him!
Liú Bèi has only recently raised his troops, so there's still unease.
If you were to march east with a regiment, \Nthey will be crushed in one battle!
Excellent! Send this order to all troops!
I hereby raise a force of 200,000 to attack Xú Province from five directions...
and kill Liú Bèi.
Fadeth has the winter, cometh has the spring.
Gone hither are ice and snow. \NWhat a great time for battle.
Gōngyòu,
Go to Yuán Shào to convey my greetings.
Tell him to send reinforcements, and then come back.
Sūn Qián\NStyled: Gōngyòu
Yes!
If anything goes wrong, we would have a backup.
Sire, divide your troops to guard Xiàpī and Xiǎopèi.
While this forms an ox-horn defense,
with the distance of the two places though,
if something were to happen-
You needn't say more.
Sir, Cáo Cāo is cunning and nefarious.
With a chance of a raid, you must be very careful.
Gōngyòu, you needn't worry too much.
Take good care.
Yuán Shào\NStyled: Běnchū
My Lord?
With Cáo Cāo's expedition against Liú Xuándé, Xǔchāng is undefended.
Tián Fēng\NStyled: Yuánhào
We should exploit this by moving our troops there
in the name of rescuing His Majesty as well as the masses.
This would also solve Liú Bèi's crisis.
This is our chance. \NPlease, my Lord, make a decision.
I too know this is most opportune, \Nyet my heart is very confused.
Raising troops might do no good.
We can't miss this opportunity!
I could die!
My Lord, why utter such words?
I have five sons.
Only the youngest one I hold so dear!
I don't want to him to die from scabies!\NIf he is about to die, my...
my mind will be troubled! Troubled so!
My Lord!
We will discuss military affairs later.
My Lord!
My Lord!
When you return back to Xuándé, \Nexplain the matter thoroughly.
I will come to you when I'm feeling better.
I will help you.
It would be easier if Second Brother were here.
Zhāng Fēi\NStyled: Yìdé
Don't worry, Elder Brother!
The enemy is coming from afar, so they will be exhausted!
They won't be prepared if you raid their camp!\N Their defeat is guaranteed!
I have always regarded you as a warrior.
Back then, you managed to capture Liú Dài with clever planning.
Now your plan is in harmony with the Art of War.
Good! I shall leave to make preparations!
Select elite troops to raid the camp!
Alright! Wait!
Tonight, we will raid the camp together.
Yes!
Sire, Cáo Cāo's attack on Xú Province isn't the same as last time!
This matter is urgent. Sir, hurry back to Xú Province!
Yes! I shall take my leave.
Master Sūn!
Sir, return to Xú Province.
There, send someone to hurry over to Xiàpī and inform Yúnchǎng!
Because this matter is urgent, \NI will go to Xiàpī myself.
Tell Yúnchǎng that the enemy is approaching and that he must be careful.
Men, halt!
How could the flagpole be broken by wind out of nowhere?
Gentlemen, what do you think?
What does it bode?
Chancellor, why halt our march?
A great wind broke the flagpole. The Chancellor asks what it could mean.
Where did the wind come from?
From the south-east!
What color was the flag?
It was the Chancellor's standard! The flag was red!
Guō Jiā\NStyled: Fèngxiào
Then Liú Bèi will certainly raid us today.
Those were my exact thoughts.
Order all units to standby!
Divide troops into nine! Leave one to build an empty camp! The others shall ambush from all eight sides.
Yes!
The Heavens smile upon me.
Advance!
Death!
Uh oh! We fell into that traitor Cáo's plan!
Retreat! Retreat!
Elder Brother!
Third Brother!
Guān Yǔ is protecting Liú Bèi's \Nfamily. He'll die guarding Xiàpī.
If you don't obtain him now, I fear Yuán Shào may.
Wényuǎn, I have long admired \NYúnchǎng's martial prowess.
I wish to have him for my purposes.
It would be better to pressure him into submission.
Yúnchǎng is fiercely loyal.
Yúnchǎng and I are acquaintances. I will persuade him.
However...
Zhāng Liáo\NStyled: Wényuǎn
Chancellor,
Yúnchǎng has the strength of ten-thousand men;
he can only be swayed by cunning.
We should send back Liú Bèi's surrendered soldiers back to Xiàpī, and claim that they deserted.
Lay ambush within the city, \Nand lure Yúnchǎng out to fight us.
I will fake defeat to lead him somewhere else
and have elite units cut off all escape routes.
I will ask for his surrender then, and end this matter.
Guān Yǔ\NStyled: Yúnchǎng
General, how can the sky be red today?
Is it the beacon from Xiàpī?
Yúnchǎng?
Yúnchǎng?
Yúnchǎng?
General Guān, do you really want to fight to the death?
A warrior without weapon.
Do you plan to mock me?
Not at all. Let me tell you of last night's battle.
The Chancellor was already prepared and had ambushes on all eight sides.
He has this mountain besieged as of now.
Yúnchǎng, trying to force your way \Nto Xiàpī simply isn't possible.
Chancellor Cáo has already broken into the city.
Please think this over, Yúnchǎng.
Wényuǎn, do you intend for me to surrender?
No.
Back then, you saved me.\N How could I not repay that?
Then will you break me out of this siege?
I cannot.
If you won't help me, then why are you here?
Yúnchǎng,
There is no news of Sir Xuándé's survival. Sir Yìdé as well!
This time when Chancellor broke\N into the city, we left citizens unharmed.
The Chancellor sent someone to watch over Sir Xuándé's family.
That is all I want to say.
Then you do wish me to surrender.
Now I am at my end, as good as dead.
Go back whence you came, \Nand we will battle to the last!
Yúnchǎng!
To answer with such, do you wish ridicule upon yourself?
I will die with honor! \NWhy would I be ridiculed?
Sir, if you die in battle, \Nyou will have committed three sins.
Explain yourself.
Previously, you and Lord Liú formed a bond for justice,
vowing to share life and death.
Now with Sir Liú's defeat, \Nyou wish to fight to the death.
Would that not be betrayal to your oath?
How could that not betray your past oath?
That is your first sin.
Lord Liú has entrusted his family to you.
If you die now, his wives would be without any support!
How could that not betray his trust in you?
That is your second sin!
You abilities are without peer, and your learning vast.
Yet you don't consider aiding Sir Liú to save the Hàn Empire, but recklessly tread on fire.
That is a fool's bravery! How is that virtuous?
That is your third sin!
These are your three sins, and I had no choice but to show you them.
You say I have three sins. \NThen what do you wish of me?
Lord Cáo has us surrounded on all sides.
If you don't surrender, you'll certainly die.
To die would be for naught.
Better to surrender to Lord Cáo.
There, you could wait for news of your master, then return to him.
Firstly, you would protect the two ladies. Secondly, you would not betray your oath.
Third, you could exercise aid for all.
With these three reasons, you should reconsider!
For your three reasons, I will answer with three terms.
If Lord Cáo is able to heed it, I shall cast off my armor.
If he won't accept it, I would rather die in battle with my three sins!
The Chancellor is bounteous. How could he refuse?
He'll listen to your three conditions.
First, me and the Imperial Uncle made an oath to restore the Hàn Empire.
I am ceding to the Emperor only, not to Cáo Cāo.
Second, my sisters-in-laws' residence shall be supported with their husband's imperial salary.
Everyone, regardless of rank, is not allowed to enter.
Third, once I find out the Imperial Uncle's whereabouts,
be the distance a thousand or ten-fold,
I will leave Lord Cáo to search for him.
If one of these three is refused, I will never surrender!
I expect you, Wényuǎn, to report this now!
He will leave once he finds out where Liú Bèi is?
Then why even bother keeping Guān Yúnchǎng?
Chancellor, you don't need to worry.\NYúncháng's relation to Liú Bèi is only of kindness.
But if Chancellor were to show more favor to Yúncháng, you would win him over.
Why worry of Yúncháng's stay then?
Chancellor, is it not for Yúncháng's loyalty that you admire him of?
He is an honorable man who will repay his dues.
Wényuǎn, you are correct.
Good! I accept his three conditions!
Yes!
Wait.
All troops surrounding the mountain are to retreat 3,000 lǐ.
Allow Yúnchǎng to enter the city and meet with the two ladies first.
Understood!
Second Brother.
Please forgive me for my absence.
I left the city to fight, \Nbut was besieged at the mountains.
Cáo Cāo sent Zhāng Liáo to persuade my surrender. I accepted with three terms.
First, I concede to the Hàn Empire, not to Cáo Cāo.
Secondly, he is to support the two of you.
Your residence cannot be entered by others.
Third, once I discover my elder brother's whereabouts,
I will leave Cáo Cāo to find him, no matter the distance.
I could not ask for your thoughts. Please forgive me.
Second Brother, do you know where the Imperial Uncle is?
I don't know...
Yesterday, when the Cáo army \Nentered the city, we would've died.
Yet no one had intruded us; \Nnot one soldier dared to enter.
Now that you've sealed your agreement, why discuss it with us?
I only fear that, in the future, Cáo Cāo won't allow you to search for the imperial uncle.
Don't worry, sisters-in-law. \NI made sure to have my say in it.
In that case, you can make the decisions. \NYou don't need to discuss them with us.
Please, Second Brother, be on your guard.
Sisters-in-laws, please come in and rest!
This defeated general is very grateful\N for the Chancellor's mercy.
I have long admired your loyalty and integrity.
To meet with you today is my greatest fortune.
Chancellor, Wényuǎn received my three terms.
Chancellor, I hope you won't violate your promise.
I made my promise.\NHow could I dare violate it?
If I know the imperial uncle's location,
I will search for him by hook or by crook.
I'm afraid I might not bid you farewell then. \NPlease accept my discourtesy.
Where Xuándé is at is where I will send you, sir.
I only fear he may have already\N died within my army's arrival.
Sir, fear not, for I will ask everywhere for him.
Thank you, Chancellor!
