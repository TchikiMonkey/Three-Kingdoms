This is a Gentlemen of the Hàn free fansub.
Sister-in-law, please board the ship!
Please.
Crossing the Yellow River meaning going into Héběi's territory.
I will be able to see my elder brother.
How could one's emotions not overflow?
Farewell, Xǔchāng! I hang my seal and stow away my riches.
I cut through the generals of the pass to look for my elder brother.
To see my elder brother's face, I, Guān Yúnchǎng, would die a thousand times without regrets!
Yunchang, slow down!
Yunchang, slow down!

General!
Gongyou!
Gongyou!
General Guan!
Gongyou!
Gongyou! Where were you after we were defeated?
I wandered around Rǔ'nán!
Gongyou!
General!
Ever since I fled from Xú Province, I wandered Rǔ'nán.
Luckily, I met Liú Pì, who gave me shelter.
I was sent to Héběi to ally with Yuán Shào.
I asked Xuándé to form a plan together to destroy that Cao.
Yuan Shao's strategists did not approve.
They all resent each other and fight for influence.
Yuan Shao is suspicious and\Nhis final decision is not yet set.
I was discussing with the\Nimperial uncle to plan our way out.
The imperial uncle has already left to Rǔ'nán.
I was afraid you didn't know and\N that Yuan Shao may harm you upon your arrival.
Thus, I was sent to meet you.\NIt's fortunate I met you.
General Guan, you can hurry to\NRǔ'nán to meet with Our Lord.
To go back would be dangerous, but it has come to this.
Even though I don't want to, I must face it.
Ladies, are you feeling okay?
Sisters-in-law, don't be sad.
The imperial uncle is at Rǔ'nán.\NIn a few days, you can meet him again.
If you, sir, had not escorted us through the passes,
the two of us would never see\Nthe imperial uncle ever again.
Guānyú, cease moving!
Who are those approaching people?
Guanyu, cease moving!
Mister Sūn,
guard the chariot first.\NI will deal with this myself.
Wait for me to finish this; then we'll move.
Go!
Xiàhóu Dūn\NStyled: Yuánràng
You came after me but may lose the Prime Minister's favor.
The Prime Minister did not send word,
yet you kill and blackmail my men along the way—
it pushes the law too far!
Today, I'm here to stop you.
Tell that to the Prime Minister, first!
The Prime Minister made it clear that,
going forward, I had no need to ask,
no reports to turn in.
If my generals make trouble, they deal with it, too.
I've been clearly told this many times,
but one must drop their weapons to pass over a mountain.
And what an easy target then! If I leave no mess, I'll get asked no questions.
Qín Qí's head was mine as well, so I just did my part.{\i0}
 {\i1}It's nice to have Dukes like Cai Yang...{\i0}
They take the job—and the price of it, too! {\i0}
General, you cannot fight with Yunchang!
The Prime Minister admired General Guān's\Nloyalty. Regarding the passes,
I relayed the order for General\NGuan's free passage en masse.
Guanyu, in his haste, killed those generals!\NDoes the Prime Minister know that?
Not yet...
If so, wait for me to arrest Guanyu\Nand send him to the Prime Minister!
You speak lies, fool!
Today, we will decide who is champion!
Die!
General, stop!
General, stop!
General, stop!
But I received the Prime Minister's\Norder to arrest Guanyu!
Wrong! The Prime Minister was worried\Nand had me pass along his orders yet again!
He ordered the guards\N not to hinder General Guan!
Did the Prime Minister know of the skirmishes!?
Not yet!
Then if he does not know of the killed...
we cannot free him!
Get him!
Sir, you have frequently disobeyed the\NPrime Minister. So, here we are.
Is it not because I killed Qin Qi?
Are you are here to resolve this grievance?
Yes! What of it!
If so, I will no longer care for killing the Prime Minister's favorite general.
How would it be inappropriate then?
Yunchang, stop this!
Yunchang, stop this!
Yunchang, stop this!
Zhāng Liáo \NStyled: Wényuǎn
I have the Prime Minister's orders!
Hearing of Yunchang's killings, he feared the passes would halt his advance,
so he sent me throughout the\Npasses to grant passage for him!
Qin Qi is Cai Yang's nephew,\Nwho had him entrusted to me.
Now that Guanyu killed him, how could I ever rest?
I know General Cài himself has his own views,
but by the Prime Minister's\Ngenerosity, Yunchang has passage.
We cannot disobey that order!
Someday, we will meet on the battlefield!
Yunchang, where are you going now?
I don't know where my elder brother is.
If you don't know where Xuande is,\Nwould you like to join the Prime Minister again?
How would that make sense?
Wényuǎn,
along the way, I committed a many misdeeds.
If I turn back now and face the Prime Minister again, how would I be forgiven for my sins?
Yunchang.
Yunchang!
Death!
Stop!
Stop!
Leave your horses and weapons behind!
How do you madmen have the gall to dare to stop me!
How amusing of you! \NNow leave your horses!
Then it seems the one who will steal my horse is but a petty thief!
Shut up! Men, let us kill him!
Die!
Dismount! Leave your weapons behind!
Yuan Shao, we need to be less rash! We \Nalmost committed a serious offense to heaven!
What are you—
Zhōu Cāng pays his respects to General Guan!
General Guan!
Where are you going?
This man had reported that there\Nwas someone riding a fast steed.
We stayed over at his father's house, inviting us to steal such a steed.
We never knew it belonged to you,
the hero, Guan Yunchang!
We are extremely lucky to have this auspicious occasion!
General Guan!
How did you know of my reputation if you never saw my face?
General, back then, you, the imperial uncle, and Zhāng Yìdé
beat that inspector at Ānxǐ.
The court distributed wanted posters everywhere!
Ever since, we have never forgotten your... integrity!
I have always been eager to see you!\NI wish we wouldn't meet like this...
Gentlemen, you may all stand up.
Thank you, General Guan!
He didn't mean you!
I have travelled a thousand lǐ, escorting my\Nsisters-in-laws to find my elder brother,
all on this horse!
Who do you think you are, having the gall to plot against me!
Halt!
Look at his parents' faces. Spare his life.
Over!
Come back!
Return him to where he belongs.
You can no longer fool around drunkenly like last night!
Be more filial to your parents!
Get out!
Thank you, General!
General!
I have long admired your virtuous reputation!
Zhōu Cāng
Now that I am blessed to see you,\NI will live out a comfortable life!
I am willing to follow you everywhere!
I will lead your carriage and your horse willingly, and I am content with death!
General!
Sir, please rise.
General Guan, please mount your horse!
"Mount your horse?"
General Guan, please mount your horse!
General Guan, please mount your horse!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Sir, may I ask what is the land behind you?
Ten lǐ before me is Gǔchéng.
Hasten our march! We will rest\Nonce we arrive at Gǔchéng!
Traveller, may I ask if you are an official?
What are you suggesting?
A few days ago, there was a true\Nman descending from the mountains.
He entered the city and asked for food.
The county magistrate refused. That man got so furious he seized the seal.
He seized the city and exiled the magistrate.
That man ordered men to purchase horses in the city and has been storing provisions.
He obtained three to five thousand\Npeople and no one dared to fight him.
Sir, do you know this man's name?
It is Zhāng Fēi.
Zhang Fei?
Sisters-in-law!
We found Yìdé!
Where is he?
He is ahead in Gǔchéng!
Go!
Zhāng Fēi\NStyled: Yìdé
What weapon is this?
General, you are rash, so you might enjoy this
Green Dragon-Crescent Blade, just like what General Guan uses.
Huh?
General, forgive me! I'm a crude person, and my memory is bad.
Someone reminded me yesterday that the general only allowed himself to answer to the name
"General" Guan in his dream, but he didn't allow others to mention it in person.
Why didn't I remember it today? I...I...damn it! Damn it!
Gongyou!
It really is Yìdé, Yide!
Mr. Sūn!
Mr. Sun, do you have any news about my eldest brother?
Let me talk slowly about the uncle's affairs.
Now that Yunchang is accompanying the two sister-in-laws
towards Gucheng, Yi De,
why don't you wait outside the city to welcome him?
Yìdé, are you not happy to welcome him?
What?
Give me my weapon!
Yide!
Yide?
It's Yide that's picking us up!
Sisters-in-law!
Sisters-in-law!
My third brother is coming to welcome us!
Sisters-in-law! It's Yide that's picking us up!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
Traitor, face my spear!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
Third Brother,
I'm Guanyu!
I know you are Guanyu, but\Ntoday, it is Guanyu that will die!
Third Brother!
Have you forgotten the Oath of the Peach Garden?
You have no integrity! How could you look at yourself after coming to me!
"I have no integrity!?"
You betrayed our elder brother by\Nsurrendering to Cao Cao,
thus receiving a marquis title!
And now you've come to deceive me!
We'll fight to the death!
Forgive me, sir.
I'm being forgetful.
Yesterday they did remind me,
only sire can refer to General Guan.
No one else can talk about him.
Why are you like this?
I- Please forgive me.
Sisters-in-law, sit here and watch me kill this traitor first,
and there will still be time left to let you two into the city.
Third Uncle! Second Uncle did not know the Imperial Uncle or your whereabouts!
He had absolutely no choice but to stay with the Cao faction for the time being.
After finding out the Imperial Uncle was in Rǔ'nán, he escorted us all the way here.
Third Uncle wrongly blamed him.
Hey! Sister-in-law, maybe Uncle should be concealed by him.
You'll never be a loyal subject, even if you die!
How can a man of great honour serve two masters?!
Good brother!
I'm so angry I could die! Ugh!
Gōngyòu!
It is Yide! Yide!
Yunchang is here to find you!
Why are you talking nonsense? How could he be kind?
Obviously, he came to catch me.
If I catch you, I must bring an army to the horse.
What is that? Not a military horse?
Do you still dare to hold back?
Humph! Watch me cut this off—to show my sincerity.
Go!
Come on!
Third Brother, it's complicated. It's hard to explain right now.
You can ask our sisters-of-law here yourself!
Second brother!
Third brother!
Second brother!
Third brother!
Second brother!
My good third brother!
Brother! I miss you so much!
General Guan is really not a day older than back then! Ha ha...
Here.
Everyday, General Zhang misses the imperial uncle and you.
He often wakes up screaming your names.
You met today and yet he almost killed you!
That was not fake.
General Zhang usually doesn't allow us to mention the general's name.
He gritted his teeth and stomped his fists when he mentioned it!
Yes! Yide's heart is like a mirror, jealous, with hatred, but respectable! Respectable!
Then what do you call those?!
Lady Mi
If you fight to death today, what should your second uncle say?
Do you still dare to argue?
Sister-in-law! Brother!
Look, who's here?
 Mí Zhú \NStyled: Zi Zhòng
Brother!
Today, my brothers are reunited,
and only one person is left for my eldest brother.
Tomorrow, I will go to Rǔ'nán to find my eldest brother.
When we came, we heard that the master, seeing Liu Pi and Gōng Dōu
had very few soldiers and horses, went to discuss the matter with Yuan Shao.
Oh?
Zhou Cang!
Yes!
How many people are there with Pei Yuanshao?
About four or five hundred.
Yes! I took a shortcut to find my elder brother.
You can recruit a man from Wò Niú Mountain to pick him up from the road.
Yes! Drive!
With this ancient city, it is a place for me to settle down.
I went with Mr. Sun to find my elder brother, and came here to meet.
The virtuous brother stayed and stood firm in this city.
Yes!
Good!
Don't worry, Brother! Go and return. Ah?
The front is the border of Hebei. The general can't enter lightly,
so he can only find a place to rest here.
Wait for me to meet the emperor first, and then discuss.
Go and return quickly. General Guān is still as strong as ever.
Good! Go!
 Liú Bèi \NStyled: Xuándé
Lord!
Oh!
My Lord, if you are so eager to see Yúnchǎng,
why won't you see Yuán Shào tomorrow?
I did say you must go to Jīng Province to\Npersuade Liú Biǎo in allying to defeat Cáo Cāo,
Yuán Shào agreed. My lord, you can seize this opportunity to escape.
This plan is excellent, but I wonder if\Nyou, Lord Jiǎn, can accompany me.
My Lord, no need to be worried! I, Jiǎn Yōng, \Nhave a plan for myself to escape.
Tonight is just another prolonged and painful night.
Liú Jǐngshēng is guarding nine commanderies.
Our troops have enough supplies to\Njoin together and attack Cao Cao.
I already sent someone for such a purpose.
That useless Liú Biǎo didn't wish to join together!
We share the same ancestors.
If I were sent, I would have\Nno problems convincing him.
If me and Liú Biǎo attack together...
but he defeated Liú Pì several times...
Lord Xuándé, you can try to convince him.
If so, I will go there today.
I heard recently that Yúnchǎng has left Cáo Cāo and intends to come to Héběi.
I want to kill him! This is to avenge Yán Liáng and Wén Chǒu!
Ming Gong said before Yunchang needs some use.
When my family passed, we were called together.
Where does this bloodlust come from?
Even Yan Liang doesn't get this ugly.
Yunchang can be your tiger there.
Why hate it?
In reality, I do like Yunchang. I'm speaking in jest.
Oh!
Sir Xuande can call someone to get him here immediately.
Ming Gong, I'll send Sun Gan to find Yunchang and come quickly. Goodbye!
Very good!
Once this person goes, he will never return!
 Guō Tú \NStyled: Gōngzé
General Guan!
General Guan!
General Guan, my father asked me to bring water.
General, you stood here for too long!
Please put on this robe!
General, look!
It's him! It's him! It's my elder brother!

Second Brother.
Elder Brother, we've been apart far too long.
Píng'ér, come! Come meet with your uncle.
Who is he?
Elder brother, I adopted him in Guanding village. He is my son, Guan Ping.
This one greets you, my Uncle.
Uncle.
General Guan! General Guan!
General Guan! Zhou Cang greets you!
You were to contact Pei Yuanshao. Why are you here?
General, before I reached Mount Wò Niú,
there was a warrior on horseback; he engaged Pei Yuanshao.
He killed Pei Yuanshao in an instant, and took over the mountain.
When I came to call,
only these few dared to come out.
The rest were too afraid to leave.
I challenged that warrior,
but lost to him, injured by his spear three times.
Who is this man? What does he look like?
He is herculean, but I don't know his name.
So, there's someone this powerful.
Lead the way; I will meet with him.
Yes, sir!
Come out, you brigand! Today will be your last!
General, that's him!
Is it not Zǐlóng that is coming?
My Lord!
It is Zǐlóng!
Sir magister!
-Zǐlóng!\N-Magister!
Zǐlóng, why are you here?
Ever since I bid magister farewell,
Gōngsūn Zàn became callous \Nand led everyone down with him.
Yuan Shao called on me many times,
but I refused to serve him.
Only when I heard you were at Yuan Shao's side,
had I want to come, but I didn't want to meet with Yuan Shao.
That's why I was scattered with the wind. \NYet when I was passing by,
that Pei Yuanshao came down to steal my horse,
I ended up killing him in defense, and took refuge.
Today, to meet with magister again, I am overjoyed!
To meet again today, it's truly a miracle!
I had wandered across \Nall directions, looking for a worthy lord.
But none were as worthy as you, magister.
To meet again, is truly a great honor.
Yìdé has come to welcome us.
Days have been like years! Today, we will reunite!
Third Brother!
Elder Brother!
Third Brother!
Elder Brother!
