Episode 17
Hunged seal and locked gold
After Cáo Cāo accepted Guān Yǔ's three terms,
Guān Yǔ often missed Liú Bèi on one side
and took care of Ladies Gān and Mí on the other.
whilst following Cáo Cāo to Xǔdū (Xǔchāng).
Liú Bèi having lost Xiaopei, the Xu-Province, and Xiapi in quick succession,
and had no choice but to join with Yuán Shào.
Zhāng Fēi broke out of a heavy siege and left towards Mount Mángdàng.
Sisters-in-law, you must be exhausted.
However, we still need to travel tomorrow, so please rest.
Uncle, you must be tired as well, please rest.
General, please rest. We will take our leave.
Lead me to the living quarters
Why aren't you moving?\NThe living quarters.
General, the soldiers take rest in the streets
while sir general and the two mistresses has had it hard on the road.
Under Chancellor’s orders, this room \Nis arranged just for you and the two mistresses.
Guān Yǔ\NStyled: Yúncháng
What? Just this room? \NTo house me and the two mistresses?!
General, this one doesn’t know.
These are all under Chancellor's decision.
Obscene!
Does he wish to ruin my name, \Nupheave the bond between lord and vassal?
Cáo Cāo\NStyled: Mèngdé
Chancellor.
I watched the night at thy orders,
But General Guān has been outside all night under candlelight. He simply won't sway.
You must serve the mistresses well!
Yes!
Chancellor Cáo!
I noticed your cloaks are well-worn.
Let this fine silk be your new war cloak, \Nmade just for your size!
The distance to {\i1}Xǔdū{\i0} (Xǔchāng) is significant.
For all that could trouble on the road,\N I hope you will forgive me.
This...
Everyone, come and take a good look.
It fits well, eh?
Yúnchǎng, why be so modest?
It is not due to modesty, this old robe was from the Imperial Uncle,
my brother's gift for me.
I couldn't wear what Chancellor has given, and forgotten my elder brother's grace.
So I shall wear the old robe over it.
You are indeed a man of princible.
Thank you, Chancellor!
Wait!
Yúnchǎng, why is your mount so feeble?
My body is heavy and the horse cannot bear it, thus he is thin.
Yúnchǎng, do you recognize this horse?
Could it be... Lǚ Bù's horse, {\i1}the Red Hare?
Sir, why not ride it for me?
Chancellor, this is bad!
If Guān Yǔ gets this horse, he might escape!
Yúnchǎng would not be so dishonorable.
Besides, Liú Bèi's two wives are still in the city.
Chancellor, look!
Chancellor, look out!
Get off me!
Chancellor.
Thank you, Chancellor!
I gave you a silk cloak, and you didn't kneel.
Yet I give you a horse, \Nand you kneel in reverence!
Why do you value beasts over men?
Chancellor, this horse can travel\N thousands of lǐ in one day, and you grant it to me.
Once I learn of my elder brother's whereabouts, I can be with him in that one day.
You receive this much generosity, yet you still ponder leaving?
Chancellor, I'm grateful for your kindness!
However, though I am here, my heart yearns for Imperial Uncle Liú!
Brother speaks in err.
A man should weigh the value of all matters.
Lord Xuándé's grace, may hardly compare to our Chancellor's.
Why do you wish to leave?
I do know the Chancellor has given me much,
but I also received the imperial \Nuncle's love. We swore to die together!
I will not betray that oath!
Chancellor, I cannot remain here forever!
I will repay you, sire, then will I depart!
But if Xuándé has left the world, where would you turn to?
I will follow him in death.
This man never forgot his roots. \NYúnchǎng is a righteous man in this world!
Generals, we shall march to Xǔdū!
Move away!
Return Yúnchǎng to his house.
After you, Xuándé.
Yuán Shào\NStyled: Běnchū
Xuándé, your face tells me something is amiss.
Xuándé,
I do not know why you are always aggrieved.
I have no news of my two brothers, and my family are in the hands of that traitor!
Above, I cannot repay the nation. \NBelow, I cannot repay my family.
How could anyone stay still and not be aggrieved?
I have long wanted to breach into Xǔdū. \NNow we have a rising army to do so.
Cáo Cāo has deceived his lord treacherously. \NIf my Lord were to resist him,
this will win over and unite the heroes all across the realm!
My Lord,
when Cáo Cāo attacked Xú Province, Xǔdū \Nwas open, but Your Lordship did not advance!
Now Xú Province has been conquered! \NThe army of Cáo cannot be underestimated.
It would be better to maintain our position and await for a chance to strike.
My Lord, Cáo Cāo is deceitful,
If we don't act now, I fear you will lose your ground amidst the people.
Xuándé's words are true.
Sire, Liú Bèi cannot be trusted!
You!
You belittle our strength with your tongue, do you deem me to fail?
Tián Fēng\NStyled: Yuánhào
My Lord! To ignore our words is to doom our men!
The gall!
Guards, drag him out! Off with his head!
Yes!
Sire, don't pay our loyalty with your regret!
My Lord!
My Lord, Tián Yuánhào has affronted your esteem. While this is indeed contemptible,
however, to kill your own before mobilizing any troops, would only harm the men's morale.
I hope Sire will consider this.
Imprison Tián Fēng. He will remain there until the end of the campaign.
My Lord! Sire! Don't pay our loyalty with your regret!!
My Lord! My Lord!
Assign Yán Liáng as vanguard! \NHe shall attack Báimǎ!
The main army shall follow me \Nas scheduled to advance to Líyáng!
Yes sir!
Sòng Xiàn!
	Bómǎ
Here!
I've long heard you were \Na mighty warrior-general under Lǚ Bù.
Would you honor us by taking on Yán Liáng?
Chancellor, watch me seize Yán Liáng's head!
Witness my strength!
Yán Liáng
He truly is a valiant fighter!
Chancellor, Yán Liáng killed my friend! \NI am willing to risk my life to avenge him!
Yán Liáng! Today, I will send you to hell!
Who will challenge him?!
I will!
Xú Huǎng\N Styled Gōngmíng
My Lord! My Lord!
Stop!
Sound the bells!
Chancellor, I know one man able to match Yán Liáng.
Who is it?
Guān Yúncháng.
But before, he stated he wouldn't leave until he repays us.
He would leave after he repays us. \NI can't let him join the fray.
If Liú Bèi was here, \Nhe would be on Yuán Shào's side.
If you send Yúnchǎng to defeat Yuán Shào's army,
Yuán Shào would suspect Liú Bèi and slay him!
If Liú Bèi dies, then who will \NYúnchǎng have to follow?
Good, send someone to Xǔdū and get Yúnchǎng immediately!
The men of Héběi are known to be strong.
To me, they are but a pack of squalid hounds.
Under that standard, that rider in shining armour wielding the blade-
he is called {\i1}Yán Liáng{\i0}.
To me, Yan Liang's head is like merchandise to be taken.
They are to not be taken lightly.
I may lack talent, but I can charge in, seize his head, and present it to you, sire!
There are no jests in times of war. \NYúncháng, don't be reckless.
Sound the drums!
Cáo Cāo defeated Yán Liáng with Guān Yǔ, \Nand became close allies.
{\i1}He petitioned Emperor Xiàn of Hàn to promote Guān Yǔ as the 'Precinct Marquis of Hànshòu'.{\i0}
Forging him a seal.
My Lord, my Lord, vanguard general Yán Liáng has been fallen!
What! Who could kill Yán Liáng?!
A warrior with a red face and a long beard! He wielded a glaive!
His horse just burst through, unstopped!
He beheaded Yán Liáng and left!\NOur army suffered a major defeat!
Who is this man?
He is Liú Xuándé's younger brother, Guān Yúnchǎng.
My Lord-
Your younger brother killed my most favored general!
You must be colluding with Cáo Cāo!
Guards!
Here!
Wait sire! Don't let one-sided words end our alliance!
For our {\i1}alliance{\i0}. Fine, I'll let you speak for yourself.
Since my defeat at Xú province, I haven't seen or heard of my brother Yúnchǎng's survival.
There are many across the world look alike to each other,
so how could this man also happen to be Guān Yǔ?
My lord, why not confirm this first,\N then make a decision?
Did you see the man who killed Yán Liáng?
Not yet.
I almost killed a decent man because of you
My Lord, General Yán and I were oath-sworn!
I must avenge him!
My Lord, please let me meet with the enemy!
No one could besides General Wén!
I'll give you 10,000 men. Cross the Yellow River, hunt down that fiend!
Sire, you shouldn't!
Our plan now should be to remain in Yán-City,\N and send a detachment to Guāndù as our next step.
If the situation goes awry when we cross the river, \Nthere is no turning back!
You burden us with your humdrum. \NAnymore from you will still us.
Dispatch the men. We will leave immediately!
Yes sir!
Wén Chǒu is a famed general of Héběi. \NWho will take him?
I will go!
En garde, Wén Chǒu!
Don't you dare fire, quisling!
En garde, knave!
General Guān is a real miracle-worker!
Zhāng Liáo\NStyled: Wényuǎn
Second Brother!
Second Brother!
Second Brother!
Did you hear someone call me?
No.
Was someone calling to me?
Liú Bèi! What is your excuse this time!?
What did I do wrong?
{\i1}You?
You sent your younger brother to kill my best generals!
And you dare to ask what's wrong?!
Take him out! Off with his head!
Wait! Let me have my final word!
Sire! Everyone.
Cáo Cāo heeds me with restlessness.
Now he's learned of me residing at Sire's side, fearing our alliance.
That's why he has ordered Yúnchǎng to kill the two generals, aimed to enrage Sire.
Turning me to be the target for the noble men of Héběi.
To twist Sire's own arm to kill me.
Nobles of Héběi.
Is there no one who could speak for me to Sire?
Why have I been so forsaken?
Xuándé! Wait!
Xuándé is right.
You almost harmed my virtuous reputation!
I have no way of repaying \NYour Lordship's magnanimity!
I will send a trusted messenger to meet with Yúnchǎng in secrecy.
When he learns of my whereabouts, Yúnchǎng will rush through the night join us.
We'll assist you, sire, to execute that traitor Cáo, \Nand avenge Yán Liáng and Wén Chǒu!
If I acquired Yúnchǎng, he'll be worth more than ten Yán Liángs and Wén Chǒus.
Wait.
Why not prepare brush and ink,\Nwrite this message before everyone.
General Guān!
Who is it?
One of your old acquaintances.
Let him in.
Yes!
General Guān!
Sir, who are you?
Why do you claim to be my acquaintance?
Chén Zhèn\NStyled: Xiàoqǐ
I am General Yuán Shào's subordinate, {\i1}Chén Zhèn of Nányáng.
This here is Liú Bèi's personal letter. \NGeneral Guān, please read.
"You and I made oath at the Peach-Garden, sworn to die as brothers.
Yet now a rift is between our path, how could you forget our promise?
But if you wish for fame and fortune, to achieve your triumph, my head is yours for the taking,
I will not say a word, none could suffice. \NI will await for death.
Elder Brother!
It's not that I don't want to find you,
but that I do not know where you are!
Brother, how could I betray \Nour oath for wealth and glory?
Xuándé is hoping to see you again.
If you do not want to betray your old oath, then you should go see him now.
Men are born between heaven and earth,\N giving up is not a noble path.
I understood this before coming, and I can't not understand when leaving.
I will write a letter, please sir, \Nif you could, inform my brother,
I will leave Cáo Cāo, and bring my sisters-in-law to reunite with my brother.
If Cáo Cāo won't let you leave, what then?
I would rather accept death. \NHow could I remain here?
Sir should write a reply, to reassure Lord Liú.
As it's said, \Nthe righteous do not regret, the loyal do not fear death.
Since youth, I've learned honour and integrity from books,
from stories of Yáng Jiǎo'āi and Zuǒ Bótáo,
Note: Yáng Jiǎo'āi and Zuǒ Bótáo were close friends who struggled and sacrificed for one another in the Warring States era.
lessons and principles that moved me so, that I have lived by since.
 I guarded Xiapi, without grain
and without reserves, making my last stand.
But with the lives of my sisters-in-laws
I couldn't dare to sacrifice myself, betray your trust and my duty,
thus I had to yield for the time being, \Nuntil our hopeful reunion.
Now that I have received Elder Brother's letter,
I shall leave sir Cáo,\N and return with my sisters-in-laws.
If I held the slightest sway of heart, may the gods strike me down.
I lay my hearts bare, \Nthese feelings that cannot be written.
Soon, I hope, I can be by your side.
I know my brother's heart, \NI know all unsaid questions.
If there are complaints, I am willing to bear them.
Wényuǎn, what is the matter?
I have heard you received news of sir Xuándé, and came to congratulate you.
Although my lord is still alive, I can't see him.
Why congratulate?
The relationship between you and Xuándé...
how does it compare to ours?
You and I are good friends.
Xuándé and I are both friends, and brothers most of all.
And we are also lord and vassal. \NHow could you compare the two?
Now Xuándé is at Héběi.\NSir, are you going there?
How could I betray my promise?
Wényuǎn, you must see the Chancellor\Nto convey my will on my behalf.
Yúnchǎng has decided?
A just man's words are to the point, \Nevery sentence flies true.
I shouldn't have ever agreed to his terms.
Chancellor, if not for your promise, how could Yúnchǎng follow us?
If so...
Letting him go is a pity.
But if you force Yúnchǎng to stay, he will resist.
And that is the problem exactly!
Wényuǎn, you may go.
Chancellor?
I have a plan to keep him here.
Yes!
'Withdraw'
I suppose Wényuǎn told him my will\N and the Chancellor is avoiding me?
Inform General Zhāng that I have urgent matters to discuss!
General Zhāng is resting, and will not to receive any visitors.
I ask sir to please tell the general. \NTell him Guān Yu wants to see him.
I know, but I am under specific orders from General Zhāng.
General Guān, you are no exception.
What?!
Sir, please calm.
Wényuǎn, am I not a guest?
How could you use sleep \Nas an excuse to reject my visit?!
If you won't see me, I will go see the Chancellor again!
Sir, sorry for the bother. \NWhy won't the Chancellor see guests?
I'm only a servant within the house. \NI know nothing of the Chancellor's affairs.
You know nothing?
Indeed I don't.
My wish to leave is set, how could I stay?
General,
General,
Have you checked carefully?
As according to your will, \NI wouldn't dare make a mistake.
That's good.
Then please, tell me that the Chancellor's gifts...
Have them all stay here.
Do not let anyone touch them.
Yes.
Only...
General.
This seal is received from the Imperial Court.\NPlease carry it with you, general.
This seal is from the Chancellor. I won't carry it!
General!
Now I have learned of my lord's presence at Yuan Shao's camp-
- by my promised allegiance, how can I abandon him?
Even before your generousity, I am still honor-bound.
Thus I have written this letter to offer my gratitude and farewell.
If there are more debts between us, I shall repay them in the future.
Reporting to the Chancellor!
Guān Yǔ has locked away all the gifted gold and silver.
The ten beauties have all\N been housed in a separate room.
The Marquis' seal of Hànshòu-Precinct has been hung up at the hall.
And the men Chancellor\N had assigned have been left behind.
He only took his own followers and luggage, and left from the North Gate.
Chancellor!
I can take 3,000 cavalry to go capture \NGuān Yǔ and deliver him to you, Chancellor.
Chancellor, please give the order!
Never forgot his roots, \Nparting with nay a debt or a word. What a true man!
You all should follow his example.
Chancellor, you'd let him go just like that?!
Back to your stations!\NDo not speak of this again!
Chancellor has treated Guan Yu graciously, \Nyet now he leaves without a word in person.
His writing is but insolence to your might, and shouldn't be tolerated.
If he were to join with Yuan Shao, would be like giving wings to a tiger.
Better to capture and kill him now, and remove a potential threat.
You will {\i1}not.{\i0}
I've made my promise, I will not break it.
We all live true to ourselves.
You will not chase him!
Wényuǎn?
Here.
Yúnchǎng has hunged seal and locked the gold.
Riches could not sway him, titles could not move him.
Such men have my utmost respect!
He won't have gone far, I will do him one last favor.
Wényuǎn, have Yúnchǎng halt for a moment to await my escort.
Gift him a warrior's cloak and toll for the road.
Let this be our parting memory.
