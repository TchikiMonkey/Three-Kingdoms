Episode 10
 Arrow Through the Halberd
Sūn Cè fought dozens of\Nsmall and large battles. Eventually,
the six commanderies and eigthy-one counties within Jiāngdōng were pacified.
Meanwhile, Cáo Cāo welcomed Emperor Xiàn of Hàn
and moved the capital to Xǔchāng.
He appointed himself Grand General \Nand Marquis of Wǔpíng, monopolizing authority.
By detaining the Emperor, Cáo Cāo gained the power to command all others in his name.
Then, Liú Bèi had garrisoned his troops at Xú-Province and oversees their matters.
Lǚ Bù, recently defeated, \N has joined them.
Liú Bèi had him settle at Xiǎopèi.
If they were to collaborate \Nand invade me together,
they will surely threaten my position.
Cáo Cāo,\NStyled - Mèngdé
Gentlemen, what plans do you have?
Xǔ Chǔ,\NStyled - Zhòngkāng
I'll lead 50,000 elite soldiers,
lop both their heads off, \Nand offer them to you!
Xún Yù\NStyled: Wénruò
General Xǔ is really valiant!
Still, this is a bad idea.
We just established a new capital recently;\Nwe cannot be rash and use force.
I have a plan.
Without using a single man, we will end up in a more favorable position.
Wénruò, please explain.
Although Liú Bèi governs Xú-Province now,\Nhe hasn't been appointed through an edict.
My Lord, you can petition the Emperor
to appoint Liú Bèi as Governor of Xú-Province.
Then, just secretly send Liú Bèi a message
instructing him to kill Lǚ Bù for justice.
If he succeeds,
then Liú Bèi no longer has Lǚ Bù to scheme with,
and thus our plans will work out.
If he doesn't succeed,
then Lǚ Bù will retaliate and eliminate Liú Bèi!
This is the strategem of {\i1}"two tigers competing for food."{\i0}
Brilliant plan!
Tommorow, I will memorialize\N the Son of Heaven.
Lord Xuándé!
Lǚ Bù,\NStyled - Fèngxiān
I heard that you have received an appointment from the imperial court!
I, Fèngxiān, have come to pay his respects!
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare. Please.
Third Brother!
Liú Bèi,\NStyled - Xuándé
Stop this madness! Leave!
Elder Brother, you...
Yìdé, what did I do to you\Nthat makes you want to kill me?
Cáo Cāo named you a mongrel,
and told my Elder Brother to kill you!
Lord Xuándé, could it be true that you received that message?
Well...
Please, come with me.
Please.
Xuándé!
That traitor wants to sow discord;
he wants us to be at odds!
Have no worries, brother.
I vowed to never commit an act of injustice.
Virtuous brother!
Wénruò, your "two tigers competing \Nfor food" stratagem failed.
I have another plan, \Nto "drive the tiger to devour the wolf."
Oh, how does this one work?
My Lord, you may secretly send an envoy to Yuán Shù with a message.
You only need to tell him that \NLiú Bèi petitioned the imperial court,
wanting to annex the\N southern commanderies.
Once Yuán Gōnglù hears of this,\Nhe will surely be enraged and attack Liú Bèi.
My Lord, you need to then forge an edict
ordering Liú Bèi to attack Yuán Shù.
This way, once both Yuán and Liú\Nstart attacking each other,
Lǚ Bù will start planning sedition.
That is the plan of\N'driving the tiger to devour the wolf.'
Very good.
Lǚ Bù on one side; Yuán Shù on the other.
This time, I will observe \Nhow Liú Bèi reacts.
Prepare the soldiers and set a date to march against Yuán Shù.
Sūn Qián,\NStyled- Gōngyòu
You need to task someone\N to guard the city first.
Zhāng Fēi,\NStyled - Yìdé
I will guard!
Third Brother, you can't defend this city.
Firstly, you become impetuous after drinking.
Secondly, you will abuse the officials.
You refuse to listen to others.
I can't rest assured.
Regardless, please let Yuánlóng assist you.
Chén Dēng,\NStyled - Yuánlóng
Please, my Lord, rest assured.
Prepare 30,000 troops\N to march for Nányáng.
We leave tomorrow.
Yes!
Liú Bèi?
He is just a mat weaver and sandal maker.
Now he dares lay claim to a major commandery as if he were one of the noble lords.
Yuán Shù,\NStyled- Gōnglù
I was going to attack him, \Nyet he plotted against me.
How I despise him!
Jì Líng
Jì Líng!
Here!
Dispatch 100,000 troops to Xú-Province.
Teach that bumpkin Liú Bèi...
that there is no turning back!
Yes!
First ordered to kill Lǚ Bù,
now ordered to attack Yuán Shù!
This Cáo Cāo fellow...
He let my Elder Brother be Governor of Xú-Province,
but causes trouble for him!
Before my Elder Brother left, he instructed me to drink less wine.
He fears I will mess up matters.
Today, I hold this banquet for you fellows to take an oath.
Tonight, everyone will get\N drunk just this one time.
Tomorrow, starting with myself,
everyone must quit drinking,\N to guard the city well!
I have something to say first.
Tonight, you men better drink!
Cáo Bào
General Zhāng, you may drink, but you can't be so sulky.
Right!
We were told to kill Lǚ Bù, so let's kill Lǚ Bù!
We were told to fight Yuán Shù, \Nso let's fight Yuán Shù!
Maybe it would be better \Nto beat up that Cáo Āhmán!
Note: It was very disrespectful for one to call others by their baby name if they were now an adult.
Then I wouldn't be sulky anymore.
And he wouldn't be leading my\NElder Brother by the nose anymore!
Come on, drink it.
General, I don't drink.
You don't drink?
I never drink alcohol — \NI have a natural aversion to it.
I hope you put this at rest.
A natural aversion? \NA natural aversion!
How does a soldier not drink wine?
You are a man of war,\N how can you not drink wine!
I want you to drink just this cup.
I really can't drink!
Only one cup!
That's what I'm talking about! \NThat's what I'm talking about!
Come, drink!
General, I really can't drink anymore!
Rubbish! You just drunk one,
but now you refuse \Nto have another one.
This time, I really can't \Ndrink anymore, I mean it!
One more! Just one more cup!
You dare disobey my orders?\NThe punishment is 100 strokes!
General Zhāng, before Lord Xuándé left,\Nwhat did he warn you about?
Get out of here!
You are a civil official,\Nso you take care of civil matters!
Leave me alone!
What are you all looking at?
What did I just say! Take him away!
Beat him!
General Zhāng?
Lord Yìdé, please forgive me, if only for son-in-law.
Your son-in-law?
Who is he?
He's... Lǚ Bù.
I didn't want to beat you
but now you bring up \NLǚ Bù to scare me?
Now I will beat you!
Beat him!
Lord Yìdé, you can't beat me! Lord Yìdé, you can't beat me!
General Zhāng!
General Zhāng!
If it weren't for your bastard son-in-law,
my Elder Brother wouldn't have had so much trouble!
Beat him! Beat him... as if you were beating Lǚ Bù... beat him!
Large-eyed brute! He's \Ngone too far this time!
Chén Gōng,\NStyled - Gōngtái
General, we better go at \Nonce and aid Master Cáo!
Gōngtái! What do you think?
Originally, Xiǎopèi was only a place to occupy temporarily.
Now that Liú Bèi has left for Huáinán,
you should seize Xú-Province while you can.
If you fail to seize it, it will be\N too late for regrets.
Good!
Reply to my father-in-law!
Tell him that tonight I will seize Xú-Province and let him coordinate within!
Yes!
This time, I want to see how
that large-eyed brute will \Nexplain his loss to Liú Bèi.
Jì Líng can retreat to the mouth of the Huáiyīn ad won't dare fight us after that.
We're locked in a stalemate.
Third Brother?
Third Brother?
My Third Brother!
Third Brother?
Elder Brother!
Third Brother.
Why aren't you defending Xú-Province? Why have you come here?
Elder Brother... Xú-Province...
What happened?
What happened to Xú-Province?
I lost Xú-Province!
What?
You...! You...!
Elder Brother, because you told me to follow the decree against my will,
the more I thought about it, the grumpier I got.\NWithout realizing it, I got drunk.
I beat up Lǚ Bù's father-in-law, Cáo Bào,
and he and Lǚ Bù \Ncoordinated from within.
I...
I...
Elder Brother, just punish me according to military law!
Get up!
Third Brother, what about \Nour sisters-in-law?
They were in the city...
What!
You! Third Brother! Third Brother!
What did you promise when you wanted to defend the city?
What did Elder Brother warn you about?
Now the city was lost and \Nwith it our sisters-in-law!
How is this good!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
Third Brother!
As the ancient saying goes:
Brothers are like limbs;
wives are like clothes.
Torn clothes can be sewed up,
but if you have severed limbs, \Ncan you continue on?
We three swore an oath\N in the Peach Garden.
Even though we weren't\N born on the same day,
Guān Yǔ,\NStyled - Yúncháng
we only ask to die on the same day.
Elder Brother,
Although you lost the city \Nand my family today,
how could I find peace if I let my Younger Brother die early?
Besides,
Xú-Province wasn't mine anyways.
When I got it, I wasn't glad. \NNow that I have lost it, I won't be upset.
Although my family remains within the city,\NLǚ Bù won't harm them.
We can still negotiate for their return.
Virtuous brother, you made a mistake,
but is it one deserving of death?
Elder Brother!
Not long afterwards, Liú Bèi's camp
was raided by Yuán Shù,\N losing most of his army.
After leaving Xūyí, Liú Bèi wandered vagrant\Nwith no home to return to.
At this time, Chén Gōng offered a plan to Lǚ Bù:
Let Liú Bèi return and reside in Xiǎopèi to guard Lǚ Bù left and right.
That way they could make\NLiú Bèi their vanguard in the future.
They would conquer Yuán Shù, then Yuán Shào,\Nsweeping through the realm with ease.
Lǚ Bù was worried that \NLiú Bèi would be suspicious,
so he first sent someone to return Ladies Gān and Mí back to Liú Bèi.
He was very relieved.
Liú Bèi, with his brothers, \Nled his men back to Xú-Province.
Xú-Province
Elder Brother, I will escort the sisters-in-law back to Xiǎopèi!
Alright.
Help them settle down first.
Virtuous brother!
Virtuous brother!
General.
I'm most grateful to you for\Nprotecting my family.
You needn't mention it, brother!
Hey. Where's your little sibling?
Third Brother didn't want to come here,
so he took our two sisters-in-law to help them settle down in Xiǎopèi.
Lord Xuándé,
it's not that I wanted to take over Xú-Province—
It's alright!
It's only that your little brother got drunk\Nand would hurt someone.
I feared he would delay important matters, so I rushed to defend the city.
Now that you've returned,\Nyou deserve to have it back.
It's okay, it's okay.
I've long intended to give Xú-Province to you.
Now is the right time I did it.
Better that it's you.
No.
I'm content to live in Xiǎopèi.
Well...
Fine. I'll govern the province for you now.
Please.
Gentlemen.
 Sūn Cè borrowed my troops for his expedition;
and now, he already has the entirety of Jiāngdōng.
He didn't even think to repay my generosity,
but demands I must return the Jade Seal.
This is very detestable!
What plans should I make to deal with him?
My Lord, Sūn Cè has the\Nnatural barrier of the Yángzǐ River;
his soldiers are experienced and supplied.
Due to this situation,\Nit is hard to find a suitable plan.
Hm? What advice do you have then?
We have to eliminate Liú Bèi first,
taking revenge for\Nattacking us yesterday without reason.
Once we deal with Liú Bèi, \Nwe can attack Sūn Cè; it won't be too late.
Liú Bèi?
Jì Líng defeated him just now. How could he fight back?
Although Liú Bèi has been defeated,
he and Lǚ Bù have reconciled.
In addition, Lǚ Bù looms over Xú-Province. He'll certainly bring trouble in the end.
My Lord, please consider these three reasons.
I will first deal with Liú Bèi. \NWhat brilliant plans do you have?
My Lord, you may present Lǚ Bù with gifts of gold, silk, and provisions.
This way, he'll have a change of heart,
dissuading him from deploying his troops and allowing Liú Bèi to be captured.
My Lord, first get rid of Liú Bèi,\Nthen act against Lǚ Bù afterwards.
Now this will make taking Xú-Province a really easy task?
Not bad... if we first take Xú-Province and then plot to take Jiāngdōng,
Then is it not that the Jade Seal will be...?
Good.
Good!
Hán Yìn.
Here.
I order you to send 200,000 carts of millet to Lǚ Bù.
Then I will write to him, \Ntelling him not to help Liú Bèi.
Jì Líng!
Here!
I appoint you as Grand General.
Léi Bó, Chén Lán!
Here!
You two are to serve as deputy generals!
Lead 100,000 troops and march the next day towards Xiǎopèi!
Yes!
Please.
Please.
Please.
General, please go back.
Please, please, please.
General Lǚ, no need to see me out.
Please make a reply to Yuán Shù.
I am most grateful \Ntowards him for the grain.
I won't help Liú Bèi.
Alright, I'm leaving.
Please.
Xiǎopèi only has about 5,000 troops.
How can we resist \NYuán Shù's 100,000 troops?
How is Yuán Shù so terrifying?
Just send out your little brother out to fight a few bouts with that Jì Líng!
After that we can talk!
Brother Zhāng, don't be rash.
Xiǎopèi's low supplies and few soldiers\Ncan't resist the enemy.
I think you, my Lord, should write a plea for help to Lǚ Bù.
How is he going to agree?
Gōngyòu's advice is on point. \NI'll write a letter.
Yuán Shù sent me lots of grain with a letter \Ntelling me not to help Liú Bèi.
But Liú Bèi sent a plea for help to me \Nrequesting reinforcements.
Gōngtái.
General, what are you going to do?
Liú Bèi is of no threat whilst in Xiǎopèi.
But if...
if Yuán Shù overcomes Liú Bèi
and comes to an understanding\Nwith the other lords,
we won't be able to ensure the safety of Xú-Province.
What you're worried about is true.
But if you dispatch troops to save Liú Bèi,
you can't account for it before Yuán Shù.
What a dilemma!
I have an idea!
I have a plan to keep both of them from complaining about me.
Welcome Xuándé!
Please!
I wouldn't dare turn down your invitation!
Please.
Please.
Please.
Good.
Please?
Today, I've asked you, sir, to come here
to relieve the danger \Nof you being besieged.
When you achieve your ambitions some day,\Nplease remember me.
Well let's —
General Jì Líng has arrived!
Jì Líng?
General, wha...
Xuándé, don't be alarmed.
I've invited both of you \Nhere for a discussion.
Don't be suspicious, just be calm.
General Lǚ has promised \Nnot to help Liú Bèi.
Why did he dispatch his troops?
Isn't his the intention to help Liú—
General, could it be that \Nyou want to kill me?
Not at all!
Is it that you want to kill Liú Bèi?
Not at all!
Then... what's going on?
Liú Bèi is like a brother to me.
Now you are besieging him, so I have come to the rescue.
Then you'd better kill me!
I've never been a man of war,
but I've always been a mediator.
I want to meditate peace between you two.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how?
I have a way—it will\N be settled by Heaven!
You'll soon understand!
Come, take a seat!
General Lǚ, what are you intending to do?
Come, come, come!\NLet me introduce you two to each other.
I've opposed violence for my entire life,
but the entire world thinks I enjoy fighting!
This is a really big misunderstanding.
Today, I have prepared a banquet for you.
This is a good banquet,\Nand it's definitely not a Hóngmén banquet!
Note: A Hóngmén banquet is a banquet that's really an assassination.
I want to mediate peace between the Liú and Yuán clans.
Look at me in the eyes, \Nand please stop this war for my sake!
You two each withdraw your troops and go home.
Well?
That's nonsense!
I received my Lord's order to raise 100,000 well-seasoned soldiers
to capture Liú Bèi!
You sure speak big for a dirty lout!
You have 100,000 troops. So what?
Killing you is child's play!
You dare to threaten my Elder Brother?
Third Brother...
sheathe your sword.
Let's see what General Lǚ has to say first.
After that, there will be time\N to go back and fight.
I invited you two to \Ncome here to reconcile!
How could I let you fight?
Reconcile?
It's easier said than done!
Jì Líng, you're just an insolent fool!
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?
You dare go out to compete\N with me for 300 bouts?
You bet!
Let's go!
Bring my halberd!
I told you two not to fight!
Now accept Heaven's will!
Good!
The gate is 150 paces away from us:
If I shoot my arrow through the center of the halberd-head,
you both shall withdraw your troops!
If I miss...
You may return to your camps and prepare to kill each other.
Whoever disobeys, I'll send my troops to the other party,
and fight to the death with the offender!
Are you going to shoot...?
The center branch of the halberd-head!
Alright. I'll comply with you.
I only hope you won't break your word.
Bring the bow!
It is Heaven's will!
Heaven bids you to withdraw troops!
Come!
Serve wine!
It's reconciling wine! Cheers!
General, I dare not disobey your words,
but if I were to withdraw,\Nwill My Lord believe this event?
How hard is that? I'll just write a letter to him;
you just simply withdraw.
I, Liú Bèi, am most grateful to you, General.
Without me, you'd be in danger!
You fool!
I can't believe you fell for Lǚ Bù's trap!
Lǚ Bù received lots of grain from me.
Instead, this farce of a child\Nwas made to suck up to Liú Bèi!
I'll personally lead a grand army to conquer Liú Bèi and Lǚ Bù!
My Lord, don't!
That Lǚ Bù is one of the most valiant among men, and he has the domain of Xú-Province!
If Lǚ Bù allies with\N Liú Bèi from end to end,
it'll be hard to beat them both!
But we can't let them off easily!
My Lord!
I have an idea.
Speak!
The other day, you, sir, \Nsent me some provisions.
Now today, you came\N to give me betrothal gifts.
I wonder why?
General, my Lord has heard that you have a daughter,
and that she is of a similar age to his own son.
My Lord has admired you for a long time and would like a to propose a marriage.
He wants to form a lifelong alliance,
and has sent me here to be the matchmaker.
What do you think about it?
Sir, please go to the guest room to rest.\NLet me counsel with my advisers — then we'll talk.
Thank you, General.
Hán Yìn takes his leave.
You must be really bold.
Do you think we're all fools in Xú-Province?
I wouldn't dare!
Who proposed this lousy trick to Your Lord?
By allying Yuán Shù with Fèngxiān via marriage,
the real purpose is nothing more than to take Liú Xuándé's head, is it?
Gōngtái-
How could a simple trick\N ever get past you, Gōngtái?
I ask you keep it secret, Gōngtái.
Xuándé is an ambitious \Nhero of this generation,
But his feathers have not fully spread yet.
Gōngtái, do you want\N to grow a tiger at Xiǎopèi?
Don't worry, sir. I won't let it leak out.
I'm only afraid that delaying action\Nwill make the scheme obvious to others.
Gōngtái whom are \Nyou referring to by "others"?
What's that for? I implore you,\N Gōngtái, do tell me.
I'll go to Fèngxiān
and persuade him to wed his daughter at once. How about it?
If this is so, then Lord Yuán will be most grateful to your foresight and virtue!
You just wait for good news.
I've heard that you have already agreed to join your family with the Yuán's.
Oh? You've heard about it?
What do you think?
It's good!
But I wonder, when is the big day?
The date is yet to be discussed.
Back then, during the time between the betrothal and wedding,
there are set rules of the duration.
What rules?
For the Son of Heaven, a year. For the noble lords, half a year.
For ministers, one season, and for commoners, a month.
Yuán Shù has the god-given Jade Seal in his possession...
Sooner or later, he'll declare himself Emperor.
Hey! Then do we follow the rules for the Son of Heaven?
That won't do.
Then do we follow the rules of lords?
That won't do.
Then... do we follow the rules of ministers?
That won't do either.
Don't tell me... that we have to follow the rules of the commoners?
Not at all!
Gōngtái, what are you implying?
Many lords are currently contending for hegemony.
If you unite with Yuán Shù by marriage,
are there not any people that are jealous of you?
If we select an auspicious day too far off,
then they will take advantage of our wait and lay an ambush on the wedding day.
How would that be good?
So, our plan for the present is that,
although you should've declined but have already consented,
you ought to surprise those unaware lords
and send your daughter to Shòuchūn.
You should first rent her a house there,
then select an auspicious day for the wedding.
This way, you can be safe with no risk at all.
Gōngtái, you're absolutely right. \NI'll make the preparations right away!
