This is a Gentlemen of the Han free fansub.
In the seventh year* of the Jiàn'ān era,
202 A.D.
Screenwriter:\NZhu Yaoping
Director:\NShen Haofang
Cáo Cāo invaded Yuán Shào, who, in his stress, died.
Before his death, he disinherited his eldest son, Yuán Tán, for his youngest son, Yuán Shàng.
Thus he provoked the struggle between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang.
Yuan Shang besieged Yuan Tan, compelling him to send Xin Pi to negotiate his surrender with Cao Cao.
Xīn Pí \NStyled: Zuǒzhì
Zuǒzhì, I'm thinking of returning to aid you,
but I'm not sure if Yuan Tan's surrender is sincere.
It is not sincere.
Oh? Then is it a farce?
It is no farce.
My lord, you needn't ask his sincerity.
You only need to consider the situation.
Yuan Shao has been losing for years.
His military is exhausted, and he has executed his advisers.
His sons have slandered each other, and his state is now divided in two.
Famine and disasters have plagued the people.
Both the wise and simple
know this is Heaven ending the\N allocated time of the Yuán clan.
Now Your Excellency is attacking Jìzhōu.
If Yuan Shang does not reinforce Jizhou, then he would lose his base.
But if he does reinforce it,
then Yuan Tan would pursue him.
With your esteemed might, you should strike his fatigued troops
like a brief wind sweeping autumn leaves.
The realm's greatest bane is in Hebei.
Pacify Hebei to extend your dominance.
Now, I hope you will... give me wine.
My only regret is not meeting you earlier!
"The realm's greatest bane is in Hebei."
"Pacify Hebei to extend my dominance."
Great.
With you as his envoy,
regardless of his surrender being \Nsincere of false, he still surrendered.

Your subject, Yuan Tan, pays \Nhis respects to the Chancellor!
Who are the two generals behind you?
Lǚ Kuàng and Lǚ Xiáng pay their respects!
Do you two consider each other blood brothers?
Yes.
I am aware you two were \NYuan Shang's subordinates.
Why are you surrendering now?
Chancellor,
Yuan Shang knows you came to reinforce me
and has fled to Jizhou.
He ordered those two generals to engage me
but I had told them on the battlefield,
"When my former father was alive, \NI never treated you with disrespect."
"Now why follow my brother and seek my defeat?"
When those two heard that, they surrendered.
I again told them,
"Surrender not to me, but to Chancellor Cao."
Thus these two have come
and await your orders.
When your father was still alive, \Ndespite his many humiliations,
he never once bowed to me!
Though you two pity the Yuan clan,
you cannot stand their brothers' conflict.
Now I will name you as marquises!\NYou will accompany my army!
Thank you, Chancellor!
Rise!
Chancellor!
I dare ask another question. When do we attack Jizhou and Yuan Shang?
Our supply lines are exhausted\Nand its transportation treacherous.
You can stay at Píngyuán and I'll camp at Lìyáng.
After we improve the supply lines, we will advance.
You two are now his lackeys.
What are you still doing here!?
Go away!
Report!
Yuan Shang had Yin Kai guard Maocheng to maintain supply lines from Shangdang!
The vanguard has already set up camp!
Report!
Yuan Shang had Ju Ku hold Handan, leaving Shen Pei and Chen Lin to guard Ji Province!
Troops assaulted Pingyuan overnight!
It seems Yuan Shang's really determined to defeat Yuan Tan and to attack me afterwards.
Report!
Yuan Shang's army is pressing \Ndown on Pingyuan! Yuan Tan pleads great danger!
He came so fast!
Gentlemen?
Report!
From Xuchang comes Xu You!
Chancellor, Yuan Shang has already sent troops to attack Yuan Tan,
but you're just waiting here.
Are you not waiting for lightning to smite the two Yuans?
I've already planned all this out.
You all!
Cao Hong?
Here!
You'll advance with your forces and attack Ji Province.
I'll lead a force to attack Maocheng and then Handan.
We'll meet before the walls of Jizhou!
Yes, sir!
Generals, heed my orders!
Here!
三更造饭 平明起兵 此番必得冀州
???三更早晚 平民起兵 自然备4得3冀州???{\u0\i0}
Yes!
It really is like lightning from the heavens.
Cao Cao marched his army and crushed Yuan Shang,
who had to send the Governor of Yuzhou, Yin Kui, \Nto the Cao camp to negotiate their surrender.
Chancellor?
袁尚军大败 溃走五十里
Yuan Shang's army is decimated， and only 50 li away.
现有预州刺使阴奎 奉袁尚之命
I've heard Yuan Shang has ordered a replacement from Yuzhou.
替袁尚前来请降
He'll replace Yuan Shang before their side begs for surrender.\N
前次是兄长派人请降
Last time, my brother sent someone to surrender
此番又是弟弟派人请降
And yet again, my little brother sends a messenger.
准降
Get ready.
张辽 徐晃
Zhāngliáo. Xúhuǎng.
在
Sir!
袁尚知我准降 必无准备
Yuan Shang knows I'm brigadier general and do not need to prepare.
命你二人连夜劫寨
I ordered you two to pillage the town overnight
不使其有片刻喘息之机
Not for you to have a moment of respite
是
Sir!
不管袁尚是死是活
Whether Yuan Shang is dead or alive
明晨我必亲往寨前受降
Tomorrow morning I will go to the encampment and surrender.
是
Roger!
准降？
Should we lower our arms?
丞相 我二人奉命连夜劫营
Prime Minister: My two were ordered to rob the camp overnight.
袁尚尽弃各种辎重 往中山而逃
Yuan Shang abandoned all his belongings and fled to Zhongshan.
随他去吧
Let him go.
众将
Majors!
在
Sir!
随我回军攻打冀州
Follow me back to the army to attack Jizhou.
审配
Shěn Pèi
你主袁尚已败逃中山 冀州势穷 末日已近
Your lord Yuan Shang has been defeated and fled to Zhongshan.
Jizhou is poor and the end is near.
为何还不快快投降？
Why don't you surrender quickly?
莫非要等漳河之水把冀州城全部冲光？
Do you have to wait for the water of Zhang River to flush out all of Jizhou City?
叔父 你已经在这里站了两天两夜了
Uncle, you've been standing here for two days and two nights.
还是到城楼里歇息一下
Let's take a rest in the tower.
Your subject, Yuán Tán, pays \Nhis respects to the Chancellor!
Since the time of the empire's beginning, Hebei has grown quite powerful.
Now, for princely reasons, Yuan Tan has fallen.
Yuan Shang has troops encircling the city.
But Liánchéng doesn't have a single move.
Forces have retreated to Zhongshan.
Sir, we have seized all eighty of\N Xīn Pí's kinsmen, young and old!
Sir, we have seized all eighty of\N Xīn Pí's kinsmen, young and old!
把他们请到这儿来 遵命
Invite them over here.
遵命
As you wish.
带上来
Bring them up, yeah?
Move!
Move!
Move!
Ji Province is about to fall! It's only a matter of time, so why not surrender now?
Please spare us!
If everyone in the city remains loyal to Shen Pei, then you will all die!
If there are any of you that wish to kill Shen Pei and deliver the city,
you'll be a champion for its people, highly accomplished!
After entering the city, \NChancellor Cao will award you!
Uncle!
Please spare us!
Please spare us, sire!
If there are any of you that wish to kill Shen Pei and deliver the city,
you'll be a champion for its people, highly accomplished!
After entering the city, \NChancellor Cao will award you!
Stop shouting!
Father! Father!
Father!
Mother!
When we enter Jì Province, let's not kill any members of the Yuán clan.
Anyone who surrenders, soldier or civilian, shall be spared.
Mother!
Grandfather!
Uncle!
Uncle, if you can't rely on me,
I can ask Mister Chén to relieve you.
You can't possibly keep going on like this!
It's been three days!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Everybody, back!
Chancellor, look! General Xú has captured Shěn Pèi!
They're coming now.
General Xú, please wait on your achievements!
Pathetic murderer! Look where you are now!
Pathetic murderer!
Pathetic murderer!
Pathetic murderer!
Pull him up, and bring him to see the Chancellor.
Look where you are now!
Shen Pei.
Do you know who opened your gates?
It was your nephew, Shen Rong!
My nephew swore to live and die with the city. Thus, when the city fell,
he was already a step \Nahead of me and died for his nation.
I was here yesterday to support this post.
Why were there so many crossbows on the walls?
Last two lines are a bit awkward.
I only regret it was too few!
I know you are loyal to the Yuan clan. I was just forced to do this.
Will you surrender today?
No!
Chancellor!
My entire family was murdered by this bastard!
Even if I've flogged him 800 times,
it'd never be enough to quell my hatred! Chancellor!
In life, I serve as the Yuán clan's minister; \Nin death, I'll serve as the Yuan clan's ghost!
I'm not like you lot, traitors \Nfull of slander and flattery!
Come, just execute me!
Fine. I'll respect your wishes. Anything else?
My lord is in the north, and I do not wish to die facing the south!
I'll bury you north of the city.
Much obliged!
When your elder brother, Xin Ping, received news that you surrendered,
he died in shame!
On the day my city fell,
you caused all 80 of your relatives to be executed!
Now they join Xin Ping!
There are so many righteous men from Hebei like him.
It really is a pity the Yuans did not use them to their fullest.
Had they used them, how could I dare eye this place?
Generals, follow me.
Isn't that Chen Lin? Chen Kongzhang?
When Yuan Shao was preparing his armies to attack me,
you had composed an essay, calling for an expedition against me.
In it, you had listed my crimes,
and even insulted my ancestors!
The arrow was on the bowstring, and I had to fire it.
Meaning he had no choice but to do it.
箭在弦上，不得不發耳。
Chancellor! Execute him! Execute him!
The wording you had just used was elegant.
There is not enough CPS so I opted for this. Original Sentence: 好一个箭在弦上 不得不发
明日 带上檄文
Bring me a message tomorrow
随我同到袁绍墓前 祭奠本初
Follow me to Yuan Shao’s tomb to pay tribute to the beginning.
进城
Forward!
何人大胆 违我将令
Who dares to enter Yuan Mansion
擅入袁府
without my knowledge?
News, Chancellor.
Your son is inside.
Insolent whelp, why aren't you coming down?
Father.
Did you know my orders?
I knew them.
Then why were you so brazen as to defy them?
孩儿知错 但请父亲见过一人
The child saw its mistake and knew his father was a stern man.
何人啊？
Oh? Who's that?
此乃何人？
Who is this?
此乃袁熙之妻甄氏
This is Yuan Shao's wife, Zhēn Shì.
好生照料 勿使再受惊吓
Take good care of things. Don't get frightened again.
是
Yes!
丞相
Prime Minsiter.
非公子不能保全妾家
Outsiders cannot protect the concubine's house.
愿献甄氏与公子为妻
We are willing to offer Lady Zhen as a wife for the prince.
非公子不能保全你家？
An outsider cannot guard the concubine's home？
是
  -Yes.
你是何人？
Just who are you
敢出此言
to speak like this?
妾乃袁绍之妻刘氏
I am a concubine of Yuan Shao, of the Liu family.
为何如此打扮？
Why do you dress like this?
这…
Well...
既是袁本初妻室 赠与金帛粮米
There's word that Yuan Benchu's first wife has brought gifts of gold, silk, grain, and rice.
丞相
Prime Minister.
何事？
What is it?
妾有一事相求
This concubine has something to ask.
说来
Go on.
请赐妾一死
Please bestow...an end... to this concubine.
You're really deserving of my son.
General Xǔ, you worked hard!
If you didn't have me, would you even be in this city?
We put our lives at risk\N innumerable times to capture this city!
How dare you boast!
You're just ignorant. What are you even saying?
Chancellor, Xǔ Yōu was too \Nimpudent, so I had to kill him.
Ziyuan and I were old friends, and \Nhe humored me often. Why did you kill him?
General Xu.
Please bury Ziyuan with full honors.
Yes.
Long ago, Benchu and I commanded our armies together.
Benchu once asked me:
If this doesn't work out for you, what do you have left?
I asked him: "Friend, what are you saying?"
Benchu said:
So, the south's held the river, the north revolts for generations,
and when stuck in the desert region, too.
If marching directly is obvious, could we get across the river?
I replied:
I'll trust the mandate of heaven.
An emperor's path is not the same as an official's.
That, I did say before,
and now, Benchu's already gone.
And now, I must hold back tears.
But to meet the people of Hebei armed is its own difficulty.
Xu Chu?
Here!
You will have the graves of Ju Shou, Shen Pei, \NXin Ping, and other gentlemen from Hebei prepared.
Yes!
Yuan Tan, Yuan Shang, and Yuan Xi
only cared to fight each other.
They are all unfilial children!
Although they are still alive and struggle, their end is nigh.
Cao Hong, you will install their graves too, and mourn their father.
Yes!
Chen Lin?
I am here.
Take the document you wrote back then out.
Read it!
Sikong Cao Cao:
his grandfather Cao Teng, 
with the eunuchs, have wronged us all.
His father, Cao Song, was brought by beggars. 
He bribed power and has now 
inherited the ugliness because of such behavior!
He had no virtue and was cunning.
丞相 别让他念了
Prime Minister, don't let him read it!
丞相
Prime Minister!
Read it! Why not read it?
When this article was spread to Xudu,
our side suffered a headwind and was ill in bed.
After reading this article, my hair is terrifying,
I am in a cold sweat, and I can't think clearly,
so I can cite an army of 200,000, 
enter Liyang, reject Yuan Shao, 
and fight to the death!
Haha... Zhennai writes like an arrow!
When this arrow was fired,
it made corpses of strong men on the battlefield,
and their souls returned to the west.
I, Cao Cao, am not affected by this arrow.
A "brave" man can calmly prepare and bury the dead.
and rest his head on the meadows!
The stars are shining, and its radiance is like words.
If you don't read this article,
how shall the heavens receive this blood?
Mu house for Chuxiong reverse, 
grab your swords and drums, come for Dong Zhen,
grab your heroes, and make use of your blemishes;
surely this will make you go consult your counselors,
your granters, your teachers, 
your lackeys, and even your dogs for their skills.
Your country is defiled, and your people are ghosts!
Li Guanzai, an innocent minister,
greedy and cruel, and very good at handling.
Those who get the first level of Cao Cao
will preside over five thousand households and receive a reward of fifty million!
Announcing the world and making everyone aware of the difficulty
of the imprisonment of the holy dynasty is like a law

After a long delay here, I am afraid that Liu Biao in Jingzhou has another strange heart!
诸公稍待 无须几时
Hmm! The princes wait for a while, and it doesn't take a long time,
