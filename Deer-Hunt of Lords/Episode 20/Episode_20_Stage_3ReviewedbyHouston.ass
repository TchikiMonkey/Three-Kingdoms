Episode 20
Sūn Cè's death
Sūn Cè dominated Jiāngdōng,
seizing Lújiāng and gaining vigorous momentum.
Once finished, Zhāng Hóng was sent to Xǔchāng\Nto announce their victories.
But his request to become Grand Marshal angered Cáo Cāo and so it was refused
and thus Cè harbored concerns in his heart.
He always planned on assaulting Xǔdū.
Ergo, the Administrator of Wú Commandery,\NXǔ Gòng, clandestinely
Xǔ Gòng
sent a messenger to Xǔdū,\Ninforming Cáo Cāo of these developments.
At night, cross the river.
Deliver this to Chancellor Cáo in Xǔdū.\NYou must not reveal this.
Yes!
Wait!
This is extremely classified. You ought to be careful.
Yes!
Who is crossing the river? Hurry, stop!
The Administrator of Wu Commandery, Xu Gong!
During the day, I saw Sun Ce drill his army!
I then crossed back here!
My lord, our men have enough food.
If you can wipe out \NHuáng Zǔ and cut down Liú Biǎo,
you would only need to rely on the\NYangtze to protect Jiāngdōng
and thus have no worries of the rest of the world!
Zǐbù, your views of the world\Nare different from mine.
Oh?
As of now, Cao Cao controls the Emperor\Nand thus the warlords as well.
Yuán Shào has Héběi and \Nis a fierce tiger among others.
How could I regard Jiāngdōng as the realm
and take no actions whatsoever?
My lord, you vigorously drilled our army yesterday.
Now we have come here to\Nmonitor the building of ships.
Is it possible... is it possible that...
Report!
Report. An envoy of Xu Gong was crossing the river\Nand was detained by our patrols.
Sun Ce is brave and valiant, akin to Xiàng Jí.*
*Xiàng Jí was a powerful warlord\Nwho contributed to the fall of Qín.
The court ought to reward him,
and then summon him to the capital.
You must not let him dominate Jiāngdōng,
or he will serve as a menace!
As of now, the realm is in great chaos,\Nand the warlords are competing.
Those with no grand ambitions\Nwill be subject to other people.
Zǐbù, what is it about the world that I think of?
You should know, right?
Sūn Cè\NStyled: Bófú
General Sun Ce has sent\Nsomeone to give you a message!
General Sun is hosting a\Nbanquet in Jīng Province,
and has asked for you, sir, to come with us.
Let me prepare my chariot and horse.
I will pack in a moment.
Mister Xu, no need to prepare your vehicle.
General Sun already has done that for you!
My lord, look.
You see that?
Yeah.
My lord, this is...
What is happening?
Who is that man?
My lord, that is-
Sir! Sir!
That is an immortal! You better kneel down to him!
Scram! Scram!
What "immortal?"
Go ask who he is!
Sir, the exalted immortal will punish us if we don't kneel! How would that be good?
My lord! Get down now! Now!
Zǐbù, don't tell me even you\Nbelieve in those omens!
Now!
My lord! If you don't get down,\Nyou better get out of here!
You can't stay here! You can't stay here, my lord!
I am Sun Ce of Jiāngdōng!
Why are none of them kneeling to me?\NThis is extremely detestable!
Zhòngmóu, please task General Chéng Pǔ
to order people to locate the\Nwhereabouts of those suspicious men.
I understand.
Come back!
Their locations are not of importance.
Tell General Cheng to capture that sorcerer!
As you wish!
My lord, just then, it was\Njust the people of the city
seeking help from that immortal. That is just a trifle.
Zhāng Zhāo\NStyled: Zǐbù
My lord, why be angry then?
How can I not be angry?
I am the exalted lord of this region!
How can the people pledge\Nthemselves to a sorcerer! What is next!
I intend to find out that sorcerer's identity
and his way of bewitching the citizens of the city!
My lord.
Exalted madam!
Your son provides his respects to you.
Rise now.
My son, why do you look so unhappy?
Mother, why come here?
I've been inside too long.
Just now, I heard people saying that\Nan immortal had come to the city.
It is said he cured the sick with such precision.
There were those who asked for predictions and his telepathy is as if he were a spirit.
As I have sat by with nothing to do,\NI want to see him for myself.
Mother, the markets are littered so why take a walk?
Even so, how can an "immortal" exist?
I seldom go out to walk, so I want to expel boredom\Nand have some fun!
The folks' words may not always be false.
In this world, there are many things.
Indeed so, there are many interesting things.
Come out! All of you, come out!
Who is it...
...that heard the preachings of that sorcerer\Nand spread them to my mother's ears!?
My lord, all of this will be taken care of by us.
Please don't anger your mother!
Hey! You folks, stop hesitating\Nand help our lord to rest!
Hmph! If that sorcerer is still here,\NI cannot be at peace!
What else can I rest on?!
I am going to Dāntú Mountain to hunt and amuse myself!
As to ease my mind!
Back then, on the lofty Shéntíng Ridge,
I ascended to worship the temple there,
facing the deitious image of Guāngwǔ
and swore an oath before it.
Not sure if he is thinking of the Emperor.
If I can revive my late father's\Nfoundations in Jiāngdōng,
I will improve the temple
and worship at the snake's hours.*
*9-11 A.M, based on the "Earthly Branches"
Today, if Jiāngdōng is in prosperity,
I will again improve the temple.
If I am able to reach the summit of Mount Gāo,
I will build another temple.
This will inspire the masses to follow me\Nand stand tall and see the world.
To eulogize such pioneers, wouldn't it be great?
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord? My lord?
My lord! My lord!
My lord! My lord!
My lord,
I was too careless!
I came one step too late!
Zibu,
I want to improve the temple of Guāngwǔ\Nso people stand tall and see the world every day.
so that everyone can be able to\Nnever forget such grand ambitions.
How do you feel about that?
Good.
How severe is his condition?
I wouldn't dare hide it. The arrow had poison,\Nwhich has already entered his body.
He must rest for a hundred days and do nothing.
My son has suffered from this calamity
all because of his volatility and arrogance.
Hang it there.
To the right.
My lord, you can get up!
My lord!
A blessing from the exalted Heavens!
Mother...
Husband!
What blessings from Heaven?
I am destined to be a hero, not to die.
How could Xu Gong's servants be able to kill me?
If you rest, you will become stronger.
For two months, I've told myself at all times to keep my spirits up.
Your injury has not healed yet.\NYou must go back and rest.
What are these?
You were in peril so your mother and I, along with the mansion servants,
begged on your behalf to an immortal, a prayer for a swift recovery.
You are too young and volatile. If there is a disaster, your troubles will never end!
All of these fall to my personage alone.
The entire mansion is also\Nfooling around with these devils!
I, Sun Ce, have my destiny, yet some\Nhave asked immortals to bless me.
I really detest those evil spirits, sorcerers, and misleading "prophets."
Hurry and tear them out!\NDo not let me see them again!
Yes.
Who dares!
If there are no immortals to help,\Nwould you be here today?
Sun Ce's wound slightly recovered.
He heard that Zhang Hong, sent to Xǔchāng to report his victories,
had an envoy return.
He thus swiftly summoned him.
Sir, how many days were you here?
The Envoy
It has been six days.
When will you return to Xǔchāng?
I will go back to Xǔchāng tomorrow.
General, can you inform Zhang Hong of this?
I would, only that Zibu won't let me speak.
My lord, your wound hasn't healed yet and you have been playing Go for too long.
I believe that's enough for today.
Stop.
Since the envoy will return to Xǔchāng tomorrow,
I only ask one thing of you.
I beseech you, Zibu, to not halt such.
I just want to ask this gentleman:
Does Cao Cao really fear me?
It's true.
Hmph, he wouldn't really say that.
It is most certainly not a lie.
Cao Cao really does fear Your Lordship.
His tent advisors too all follow his Lordship. Only...
Only what?
Only what?
His Lordship said that he only asked one question.
Yes, yes, yes!
Yet I have spoken too much, so I must take my leave.
Allow me one last sentence.
I hope my lord has the strength of 10,000 gold and will get well soon!
What "strength of 10,000 gold?"
I think you want to provoke me!
Speak.
Speak.
Who is it that disobeys me?
Only Guō Jiā disobeyed.
Guo Jia?
What did he say?
My lord, you will get angry!
Guo Jia's words really cannot be told to you!
I take my leave!
Mister, halt.
Sir, such words have already come out,\N yet you would leave without finishing it.
Would it not make our lord even angrier?
No matter what words they are, please finish before leaving.
Guo Jia had heard Cao Cao's words.
My lord, he was not at all afraid!
Go on.
He said that Your Lordship is condescending but unprepared, 
impatient and lacking in plans,
and thus, an ignorant brute!
There is more?
Yes...
Speak!
Okay!
He said... Your Lordship would certainly die\Nat the hands of a lout one day!
My lord, Guo Jia is just an ignorant man!\NHe'll be dead soon.
But My Lord, you shouldn't become furious!
How can that dunce dare say such!
I vow to capture Xǔchāng!
Zibu.
Here.
It has been several days since\NYuan Shao sent his envoy, Chén Zhèn.
Why not report on this?
That...
You. Quickly leave and inform Master Chen Zhen...
that I want to ally with Yuan Shao\Nand attack Cao Cao together on cue!
That... that...
Tommorow, let us summon\Nour generals to the city top.
And tell Master Chen Zhen to leave as well.
Our talk to attack that Cao is important.
The doctor warned Your Lordship to rest for 100 days.
Why, because of this, you became furious, \Nespecially at "strength of 10,000 gold?"
Gentlemen, do rise.
Do rise.
Mister Chen Zhen is Yuan Shao's envoy and shall be the guest of honor.
After you?
After you.
Everyone present,\Nincluding the aged ministers and
the fierce generals,  you all founded\NJiāngdōng and followed me in later conquests,
just like Zǐyì.
Tàishǐ Cí \NStyled: Zǐyì
He would kill any champions\N on sight in battle.
I led Jiāngdōng into a great undertaking.
I had relied on you all. It is all due to your efforts to have today's situation.
Come! Allow me to show my respect to all you nobles!
May Your Lordship recover and\Nlead Jiāngdōng to great fortunes!
Everyone,
the troops of Jiāngdōng have enough supplies.
The commoners live in peace and work happily.
These developments are indeed gratifying.
But—
if one wants to protect Jiāngdōng, \Nthey ought to cherish no ambitions.
Those with no ambitions, however,\Nwill surely be subject to others.
We could join with Yuan Shao and resist Cao Cao.
Doing so would be today's great undertaking.
Gentlemen, we must think of danger during peace.
We must prepare supplies and troops early.
By acquiring warships and storing supplies,
we then can head north and besiege Xǔdū.
Why look out?
Down there, Immortal Yú Jí is passing by.
We generals wish to pay our respects.
Uh... my Lord?
It's that sorcerer again!\NCome with me to bring him here!
I...
He used his sorcery to mislead you!
Even you and some soldiers are bewitched as well!
If this continues, then how will I\Nhave anyone to seize the realm?
My lord!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord, this man's surname is Yu, forename Ji.
He travels everywhere to administer medicine.
He has saved many from many illnesses; there is nothing he hasn't seen!
Now he is called an immortal.
My lord, you must not take this lightly!
Scram!
Get that sorcerer and quickly slice his head off!
Anyone against this will be...
beheaded!
My lord, you can't do this!
My lord!
My lord!
Master Yu, over the years in Jiāngdōng,\Nhas not committed any crimes!
My lord, you mustn't kill him!
Of him and other sorcerers, I must kill these swine!
General, can't you see the people below revere Yu Ji ?
My lord!
To lose your temper now would be most inappropriate.
Gentlemen, you are all pragmatic.\NWhy be unreasonable?
I must vanquish evil at all costs,\Nas to pacify the world!
General, we are all united in\Nagreement to plead for his life!
Do you all want to follow Yu Ji into rebellion?
You dare incite the people into following heresy?
Yú Jí
Only I can speak on behalf of heaven to rescue millions of people.
I would never take anything from the people.
How then is it inciting the people's hearts?
If you take absolutely nothing,\Nthen where do the clothes and food come from?
It is clear you are the sly one here!
Now if I do not punish you,\Ntheir hearts will change into dissent!
Son, cease this!
Son, you know well that killing immortals without just reasons will bring misfortune!
But your words! How could you dare not trust me?
Mother, you should know your child's intentions, too!
My undertaking hasn't been completed;\Nthe empire hasn't been stabilized!
This sorcerer has caused disaster, fooled the civil officials into subservience, 
and filled the generals with terror.
The people and soldiers all regard him in awe!
If this continues, how will my father's unfinished undertaking ever come true by me?
How could I not know?
Only last time, you showed disdain to the immortal,\Nhence you risked being killed in that way!
I am... I am really scared!
The assassins of the mountain\Nwere just Xu Gong's retainers.
You want to blame me for my good intentions.
Mother, how could you be so misled now\Nand blame me for trouble!
Quiet!
My son...
your father then was short-tempered and rash.
He did not heed others, and as such he died in the mountains by some stones.
This matter is like yesterday. Surely you won't forget such?
If you are an "immortal," why kneel?
How is he?
Why aren't you speaking?
Is it good or bad?
You ought to inform the Grand Lady Tai and Madam Qiáo.
My rank is of low prestige. This being a grand matter, \NI really do not dare speak lightly.
Speak.
I am the leader, and I command you to tell me everything.
I really wouldn't dare lie,\Nbut our Lord looks to be at his end.
His Lordship's venom still hasn't healed.
And having an outbrust with such force, the poison surely leaked into his torso.
It infected his heart and lungs.\NThis ailment is already too late to heal.
This lowly servant has long received His Lordship's heavy favor,
I only regret I wasn't able to heal him back to full force now!
Mother...
I cannot be spared again.
Thus, summon my brother.
Zhong Mou...
Zhong Mou...
Zibu.
Here.
Yes.
You!
Now is not the time to cry.
You should raise yourself up and\Nuphold your father's and my great cause.
Come!
Come.
Mother, I know my years from Heaven are over
and I can no longer serve you.
Now I shall entrust my cause to my younger brother,
and I hope you will train him day and night.
My father and I will fade into the past.\N Be sure he doesn't become too idle.
I fear thy younger brother is immature\Nand cannot handle big matters.
Wrong.
If you are unsure of \Ninternal matters, ask Zhāng Zhāo.
If you are unsure of \Nexternal matters, ask Zhōu Yú.
The only pity is that Zhou Yu isn't here himself.
I cannot order him face-to-face!
You were always there for me for many years, and I have seen your hard work.
After my death, you must respect my mother.
Please order your younger sister to inform Zhōu the Youth
that he must strive to assist my younger brother.
Please do not betray me and the love we share!
